Vinknes1†, Marit B.

Our\naim was to conduct a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCT), assessing the effects of LC dietsv. low-fat (LF) diets on weight loss and risk\nfactors of CVD. Studies were identiﬁed by searching MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Trials. Studies had to fulﬁl the following criteria: a RCT; the LC\ndiet was deﬁned in accordance with the Atkins diet, or carbohydrate intake of<20 % of total energy intake; twenty subjects or more per group; the\nsubjects were previously healthy; and the dietary intervention had a duration of 6 months or longer. Results from individual studies were pooled as\nweighted mean difference (WMD) using a random effect model. In all, eleven RCT with 1369 participants met all the set eligibility criteria. Compared\nwith participants on LF diets, participants on LC diets experienced a greater reduction in body weight (WMD– 2·17 kg; 95 % CI– 3·36, – 0·99) and TAG\n(WMD – 0·26 mmol/l; 95 % CI– 0·37, – 0·15), but a greater increase in HDL-cholesterol (WMD 0·14 mmol/l; 95 % CI 0·09, 0·19) and LDL-cholesterol\n(WMD 0·16 mmol/l; 95 % CI 0·003, 0·33). This meta-analysis demonstrates opposite change intwo important cardiovascular risk factors on LC diets–\ngreater weight loss and increased LDL-cholesterol. Ourﬁndings suggest that the beneﬁcial changes of LC diets must be weighed against the possible\ndetrimental effects of increased LDL-cholesterol.\nKey words: Low-carbohydrate diets: Low-fat diets: Weight loss: Cardiovascular risk factors\nAccording to the World Health Organization(1), worldwide obesity\nhas almost doubled since the 1980s. Globally, 35 % of people aged\n≥20 years were overweight and 11 % were characterised as obese\nin 2008(1). Overweight and obesity in adults are associated with\nCVD, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer(1,2).Ar e c e n t\nsystemic analysis estimated that 3·4 million deaths in 2010 were\ncaused by overweight and obesity(3). Therefore, dietary measures\nthat can most effectively contribute to reduce excess body weight\nand improve parameters of CVD should be further explored.\nThe low-carbohydrate (LC) diet, in which carbohydrates\n(CHO) are replaced by greater intake of fat and/or protein, is a\npopular weight-loss option compared with the conventional\nlow-fat (LF) diet. However, concerns have been raised with\nregard to the macronutrient shift with an extreme CHO\nrestriction and the liberal intakes of fats, which may present\ndetrimental effects on CVD risk factors(4,5). Increased intake of\nfat, particularly SFA, have been associated with an increase in\nLDL-cholesterol, and thus increased risk of CVD(4,6,7), whereas\nthe LF approach has generally been supported by studies to\nhave advantageous effects on CVD risk among high-risk\npatients(8,9). The WHO recommends limiting SFA intake to\n<10 % of total energy intake, and other competent bodies such\nas the American Heart Association recommend restricting SFA\nintake to<7% (4). However, these recommendations have been\nchallenged in a meta-analysis, where the authors concluded\nthat there was no signiﬁcant evidence that SFA was associated\nwith increased risk of CHD and CVD(10).\nSupporters of the LC diet point to studies where subjects on the\nLC diet produced greater weight loss, greater reduction of both\ntotal cholesterol (TC) and TAG and increased HDL-cholesterol\ncompared with their LF diet counterparts(11,12). However, studies\nalso show signiﬁcant increase or lack of reduction in LDL-\ncholesterol after consuming a LC diet(12– 16), which potentially\ncould be harmful, as LDL-cholesterol is an important risk factor for\nCVD morbidity and mortality(17– 19). Therefore, concern has been\nraised with regard to the use of the LC diet, especially by patients\nwith known CVD, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidaemia and/or\nhypertension(20).\n* Corresponding author:N.

        "text": "Due to the lack of consensu s between previous meta-\nanalyses(12,15,21), authors have cautioned against making recom-\nm e n d a t i o n sf o ro ra g a i n s tt h eL Cd i e t(15,20), and thus the topic\nshould be challenged and re-evaluated. The lack of consensus may\nbe caused by the different inclusion and exclusion criteria used. For\nexample, many previous meta-analyses have allowed a greater\nrange in terms of CHO intake among subjects in the LC groups\n(ranging from 20– 30 g/d upto 40– 45 % of total energy), and\nin some studies all subjects in one group suffered from type 2\ndiabetes. In contrast, the present meta-analysis included adults with\nincreased BMI, who in some cases had associated metabolic risk\nfactors, but were altogether regarded as healthy. Studies where one\nintervention group consisted solely of subjects with established\nassociated disease such as, but not limited to, type 2 diabetes and\nCVD were excluded. Furthermore, we have reduced factors\nthat can contribute to variation by including studies with more\ncomparable baseline values. In the present meta-analysis,\nw ea i m e dt oc o m p a r eat y p i c a lL Cd i e td eﬁned as a CHO intake of\n20– 3 0 g / di nt h eﬁrst phase(22) or <20 % of total energy with\ntraditional LF diets composed of<30 % of energy as fat and limited\nenergy content(23), as well as determine the effects on long-term\nweight loss and several CVD risk factors in healthy adults by\nexamining relevantrandomised controlled trials (RCT).\nMethods\nMethods and literature search\nThe current meta-analysis is reported in accordance with the\nPreferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-\nAnalyses Statement(24). The protocol for the meta-analysis has\nbeen published with the registration number CRD42015020458\nin the PROSPERO database and can be accessed at http://www.\ncrd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO.\nWe searched databases such as MEDLINE via Ovid, EMBASE\nand Cochrane Library in Trials (CENTRAL) for relevant RCT,\nwith the last search date being 28 May 2015. In addition,\nreferences from the retrieved publications were thoroughly\nreviewed for potentially relevant citations not detected by the\nelectronic search. The search terms were related to both groups\nof intervention (‘low-carbohydrate diet ’ and ‘low-fat diet ’)\nand primary and secondary outcomes ( ‘weight loss ’ or\n‘cardiovascular disease’ or ‘cardiovascular risk’). Searches were\nrestricted to RCT performed on humans, which were published\nin English. No restrictions were imposed on publication dates.\nThe complete search strategy is available in the protocol\npublished with the aforementioned registration number.\nStudy selection\nAs the present meta-analysis aimed to compare weight loss\ndifferences between two diet groups, only studies that met all of\nthe following criteria were included: (1) the study was a RCT that\ncompared a group of subjects on a LC diet with one or more\ngroups on different variations of a conventional LF diet; (2) the LC\ndiet was deﬁned through a distinct reference to the Atkins diet,\nwith an intake of only 20– 40 g/d of CHO in theﬁrst phase or CHO\nintake of<20 % of total energy intake; (3) the dietary intervention\nconsisted of at least twenty subjects/group in theﬁrst analysis or\nafter drop out; (4) the subjects were previously healthy; and (5) the\ndietary intervention had a duration of 6 months or longer. RCT\nperformed solely on subjects classiﬁed as severely obese with\nBMI≥35 kg/m2 were also excluded, as these subjects were not\ncharacterised as previously healthy. Likewise, studies involving\nsupplementary medical therapy inaddition to diet therapy were\nexcluded. One investigator performed the searches and performed\nthe screening. Studies with irrelevant titles and/or abstracts were\nexcluded, whereas relevant studies were assessed in full text and\nincluded if they fulﬁlled the above-mentioned criteria. Another\ninvestigator also reviewed the selected studies with regard to\nwhether they fulﬁlled all criteria.\nData extraction and quality assessment\nOne investigator collected the following data: article title, primary\nauthor’s name, year, country of origin, study design, blinding,\ndietary composition, dropout rate, intention-to-treat analysis,\ncharacteristics of the study population (sample size, age, sex and\nbaseline levels of body weight and CVD risk factors) and the mean\nchanges in end points from baseline to the end of intervention,\nwith measures of variance. The main end point was weight loss\nand secondary end points were risk factors of CVD, including\nblood lipid levels (TAG, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol), fasting\ninsulin and glucose concentrations and systolic blood pressure\n(SBP) and diastolic blood pressure(DBP). If data were lacking, the\nauthors were contacted to obtain additional information. For\nstudies that had more than two intervention groups, the most\nappropriate one was chosen. If data were published as updates,\nresults of the longest duration periods were included.\nMethodological quality was evaluated by two authors using\nthe Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for assessing risk of bias(25)\nindicating the following bias categories: selection bias (random\nsequence generation, allocation concealment); performance\nbias (blinding of participants and personnel and blinding of the\noutcome assessments); attrition bias (incomplete outcome\ndata); reporting bias (selective outcome reporting) and other\nbiases. The nature of the trials required an open intervention\nwith no blinding of the trial participants or the investigators.\nAny disagreement was resolved by consensus.\nStatistical analysis\nRaw data were ﬁrst extracted from the selected studies.

When only CI for\nthe means were provided, standard deviations were calculated.\nWhen it was not possible to retrieve adequate data, standard\ndeviations were imputed from studies in another meta-analysis\n(primary analyses)(26); this was necessary forﬁve studies(11,27– 30) for\none and upto maximum three variables. For each outcome measure\nof interest, a meta-analysis was performed to determine the pooled\neffect of the intervention in terms of weighted mean difference\n(WMD) from baseline to end of trial comparing LC with LF groups.\nSummary WMD with 95 % CI for the outcome measures were\ncalculated using a random effect model(31).\nLow-carbohydrate diet and CVD risk 467\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0007114515004699\n Published online by Cambridge University Press",

Heterogeneity between\nstudies was tested using the Q test(32).T h eI2 index was used to\nquantify the extent of heterogeneity, withI2 values >50 and>75 %\nbeing indicative of moderate and high heterogeneity, respectively.\nTo further explore heterogeneity, we conducted sensitivity\nanalyses to examine the inﬂuence of individual studies by omitting\none study at a time. In additi on, subgroup analyses were\nperformed on studies sharing certain methodological features such\nas duration>12 months, low risk of bias, both men and women,\nintention-to-treat analyses and subjects with obesity-associated\nmetabolic risk factors or disorders.\nPublication bias was evaluatedusing funnel plots and Egger’s\nregression test for each outcome(33). Furthermore, when Egger’s\nregression tests or funnel plots indicated publication bias, we used\nthe trim-and-ﬁll method to identify whether funnel plot asymmetry\nshould be corrected. All the statistical analyses were carried out\nusing Stata, version 13.1 software (StataCorp LP).\nResults\nLiterature search\nThe ﬂow and selection of studies from our search strategy are\nsummarised in Fig. 1. Our searches warranted 740 potentially\nrelevant records, of which 362 records remained after duplicates\nhad been removed. After screening, forty-two records remained\nand were retrieved in full text, in order to be evaluated in\naccordance with the set inclusion and exclusion criteria. Of the\nforty-two records, thirty-one records were excluded as they failed\nto satisfy the set inclusion criteria. In addition, the references of the\nselected records were reviewed in an attempt to potentiallyﬁnd\nother relevant records, but none was found.Thus, a total of eleven\nRCT were included in theﬁnal meta-analysis.\nStudy and subject characteristics\nThe characteristics of the eleven studies are summarised in Table 1.\nAll studies were parallel group RCT , but none was blinded because\nof the nature of the studies involving diet intervention. Intervention\ndurations ranged from 6 to 24 months, with eight of them lasting for\n12 months or longer(27,28,34– 39). The diet composition goal for the LC\ndiets was intake of 20– 40 g/d CHO in theﬁrst period with gradual\nincreases or CHO intake of<20 % of total energy intake. The\ndietary goal for the LF diets was<30 % of total energy as fat.\nFurthermore, subjects on the LF diet were imposed a energy\nrestriction, whereas subjects on the LC diet were mostly on an\nad libitumdiet, except in two studies where the LF and LC groups\nwere isoenergetic(14,39). However, in some of the studies, subjects\non ad libitumLC diets also demonstrated a decrease in their energy\nintake, similar to subjects on the LF diet, although this was not\nrequired or encouraged at the outset(11,27,29,30,38). Most studies\noffered group or individual sessions of dietary and supportive\ncounselling, whereas one study had a self-help format with little\ncontact with professionals(28).

        "text": "24 h recalls were made and 3-, 5- or 7-d food records were\ncollected. Adherence decreasedover time, but studies that pro-\nvided more extensive behavioural treatment and close follow-up\nhad better dietary adherence than studies with less follow-up.\nMostly, subjects were encouragedto maintain a certain level of\nphysical activity, although none of the studies provided records of\nthe subjects’ physical activity level. There was a large variation in\nattrition rates, with drop out ranging from 12 to 50 %. We collected\ndata from analyses that included only subjects who completed the\nintervention, except for two studies that only presented data from\nintention-to-treat analysis(30,37). However, one of the studies\nreported that the results from the intention-to-treat analysis did not\nsigniﬁcantly differ from the results of completers data only(37).\nLikewise, two other studies provided data for both intention-to-treat\nand completers analyses, and similarly reported no signiﬁcant\ndifferences at the end of the intervention(28,36).\nThe baseline subject characteristics are presented in Table 2.\nA total of 1369 subjects (LC,n 688 and LF,n 681) were included\nin the eleven studies that met the eligibility criteria. Most of the\nstudies had a higher proportion of women than men, and two\nstudies included only women. The mean age of participants\nvaried between 40 and 52 years.\nReported mean BMI and baseline levels of cardiovascular risk\nfactors (TAG, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, TC, SBP, DBP,\nglucose and insulin) varied among studies but were similar in\nthe LC and LF groups in each study.\nQuality assessment: risk of bias\nResults from the quality assessment are provided in Table 3. Some\nstudies did not report on the sequence generation used, and most\nstudies did not report on allocation concealment. Blinding was\nimpossible. One study was considered to have high risk in terms of\nincomplete outcome data. No evidence of selective reporting was\nfound in any of the studies. Of the eleven studies, one study\nreceived an overall score of‘high’ in terms of risk of bias.\nMeta-analyses\nThe results from the primary meta-analyses are presented in Fig. 2\nand online Supplementary Table S1. The WMD comparing the\nLCv.L Fd i e t sw a ss i g n iﬁcant for body weight (WMD= – 2·17 kg;\n95 % CI– 3·36, – 0·99) and TAG (WMD=– 0·26 mmol/l; 95 % CI\n– 0·37, – 0·15). Furthermore, subjects on the LC diets experienced\nas i g n iﬁcantly greater increase in both HDL-cholesterol\n(WMD= 0·14 mmol/l; 95 % CI 0·09, 0·19) and LDL-cholesterol\n(WMD= 0·16 mmol/l; 95 % CI 0·003, 0·33) compared with subjects\non LF diets. Only four studies provided data on TC, which showed\nno signiﬁcant difference between the groups. Similarly, WMD for\nSBP, DBP and glucose and insulin concentrations between the LC\nv. LF groups were not signiﬁcant. We imputed standard deviation\ncalculated from studies in our meta-analysis, which produced\nsimilar results to the primary analyses with standard deviation\nimputed from another meta-analysis(12). Likewise, excluding all\nstudies not reporting standard deviation for mean differences or\nthose with imputed standard deviation from another meta-analysis\nshowed similar results, except non-signiﬁcant results for LDL-\ncholesterol due to fewer studies being included in the analyses.\nModerate-to-high heterogeneity was observed for all variables,\nwith I2 values ranging from 63 to 92 % (Fig. 2 and online\nSupplementary Table S1). We carried out sensitivity analyses\nto identify possible studies explaining the heterogeneity. The\nexclusion of each study one at a time did not signiﬁcantly alter the\nresults or the heterogeneity for body weight and insulin. However,\nfor TAG, the heterogeneity dropped considerably when we\nexcluded the study by Fosteret al.(37) (I2 = 30·2; P = 0·17) or\nBrinkworth et al.(35) (I2 = 40·8; P = 0·09), but did not change the\nWMD. For TC, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and DBP, the\nheterogeneity decreased when the study by Brinkworthet al.(35)\nwas excluded (I2 = 35·1; P > 0·10 for all), but WMD did not\nchange. The study by Gardner et al.(38) was responsible for\nthe heterogeneity in the sensitivity analysis for SBP, although\nexclusion of this study did not change the results.\nIn the subgroup analysis, we excluded studies with duration\n<12 months, with high or unclear risk of bias, with 100 % women\nor only presenting intention-to-treat analyses. The WMD were\nsimilar for almost all variables (data not shown), except for\nLDL-cholesterol, which did not remain signi ﬁcantly different\nbetween the LC and LF diets, probably due to reduction of\nincluded studies from 11 to 8 or 9. In addition, body weight did\nnot remain signiﬁcant, whereas DBP became signiﬁcantly different\nbetween LC and LF diets after excluding studies with unclear or\nhigh risk of bias(29,30,35,39). Heterogeneity was reduced for TAG,\nTC, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and DBP when studies\nw i t hu n c l e a ro rh i g hr i s ko fb i as were excluded. Similarly,\nheterogeneity was reduced for TAG when studies only presenting\nintention-to-treat analyses were excluded. In addition,\nheterogeneity was reduced for SBP and glucose levels when\nstudies with only women were excluded.\nAnother subgroup analysis was performed to explore whether\nstudies including subjects with metabolic risk factors or disorders\nwere associated with changes in WMD and heterogeneity for\nthe different variables(27,30,35,36,39). WMD was similar as in the\nprimary meta-analysis for body weight ( ﬁve studies), TAG\n(ﬁve studies), TC (three studies) and HDL-cholesterol (ﬁve studies),\nwhereas WMD for LDL-cholesterol turned out to be non-signiﬁcant\n(data not shown). Heterogeneity was no longer signiﬁcant for\nTAG, SBP, DBP, glucose and insulin. In analyses that\nexcluded studies including subjects with associated metabolic\ndisorders(11,28,29,34,37,38), the WMD was similar as in the primary\nmeta-analysis for body weight (six studies), TAG (six studies), TC\n(one study), HDL-cholesterol (six studies) and LDL-cholesterol\n(six studies). The heterogeneity was reduced for TAG, HDL-\ncholesterol and LDL-cholesterol.\nWe explored the possibility of publication bias by plotting\nmean differences against standard errors in body weight and\ncardiovascular risk factors (online Supplementary Fig. S1).\nUsing Egger’s linear regression test, possible publication bias\nwas detected for body weight (P = 0·03, eleven studies), TC\n(P = 0·03, four studies), LDL-cholesterol ( P = 0·03, eleven\nstudies) and DBP (P = 0·05, eight studies). Visual inspection of\nthe funnel plots (online Supplementary Fig. S1) suggests that\npublication bias may also be present for SBP (eight studies) and\nglucose (seven studies). The trim-and-ﬁll method was used, but\nno trimming was performed, and the WMD estimates were\nunchanged.\n470 N.

        "text": "Discussion\nIn this meta-analysis, we compared the effects of LC diets with LF\ndiets on weight loss and CVD risk factors. Compared with subjects\non LF diets, subjects on LCdiets experienced signiﬁcantly greater\nweight loss, greater TAG reduction and greater increase in HDL-\ncholesterol after 6 months to 2years of intervention. Despite\nsigniﬁcant weight loss, subjects on the LC diet experienced a\nsigniﬁcant increase in LDL-cholesterol compared with their\ncounterparts consuming an LF diet. Ourﬁndings suggest that the\nbeneﬁcial changes of LC diets must be weighed against the\npossible detrimental effects ofincreased LDL-cholesterol.\nIt is still uncertain how the beneﬁcial effects of the LC diet such\nas weight loss, TAG reduction and HDL-cholesterol increase(12,21)\ntranslate into possible prevention of CVD. In epidemiological\nstudies, HDL-cholesterol levels areinversely related to the risk of\nCHD(40), whereas results from studies on treatment that increase\nHDL-cholesterol levels have so far been disappointing(41).F u r t h e r ,\nlarge Mendelian randomisation studies indicate that increased HDL-\ncholesterol cannot be translated into a reduction in CVD risk(42,43).\nThus, whether an increase in HDL-cholesterol levels is directly\nrelated to the reduction in risk of CHD is yet to be demonstrated(15).\nOn the other hand, increased levels of LDL-cholesterol are clearly\nassociated with increased risk of CVD(18,19). A number of studies\nhave previously reported increased LDL-cholesterol levels in\nsubjects on LC diets, recognising the concerns associated with this\nchange in LDL-cholesterol concentration(12,14,15,35).C o n s e q u e n t l y ,a\nLC diet may not be appropriate for subjects at increased risk for\nCVD(11,28,36).\nBlood concentrations of LDL-cholesterol are expected to\ndecrease with moderate weight loss(44). The signiﬁcant weight\nloss and increase in LDL-cholesterol in the LCv. LF groups in\nthe present meta-analysis are consistent with several other\nmeta-analyses(12,15,16), but not all report signiﬁcant differences\nin weight loss between the LC and the LF groups (15).H u\net al.(21) concluded that dieters on a LC diet experienced\nless reduction of LDL-cholesterol, although both groups\nexperienced similar weight loss. Concerns regarding lack of\ndecrease and the great individual variability in LDL-cholesterol\nlevels among dieters on the LC diet have been raised(13,14,28,37).\nFurthermore, the role of a greater decrease in TAG\nconcentrations among LC dieters is uncertain, as reduction of\nTAG below a speciﬁc target has in itself not been proven to\nreduce risk of CVD(23). In addition, the associated alteration of\nthe LDL-cholesterol phenotype from small dense LDL to greater\nLDL has been associated with reduced atherogenicity(18,19).\nNotably, large, dense LDL-cholesterol particles are also\nassociated with increased CVD risk, especially together with\nlow TAG levels(18). Morganet al.(29) reported that the LC and LF\ndiets produced different effects on the LDL-cholesterol particle\nsize, depending on the subjects’ initial LDL-cholesterol\nphenotype, but with greater and less-dense LDL-cholesterol\nparticles in subjects following the LC diet. Others have shown\nthat subjects with large LDL-cholesterol particle size (pattern A)\nhad small, dense LDL-cholesterol particle size (pattern B) after\nbeing on a LF diet(45). Importantly, the lack of evidence that a\nchange from pattern B to pattern A leads to reduced CVD\nrisk weakens the impact of this discussion for the general\npopulation. Only one study in the current meta-analysis\ninvestigated LDL-cholesterol particle size(29). The authors\nreported that subjects on both LC and LF diets achieved an\nincrease in LDL-cholesterol particle size, but it was difﬁcult to\nestablish a relationship between the dietary effects on\nLDL-cholesterol and shift in particle size(29). This supports the\nview that weight reduction itself leads to a shift towards pattern\nA. The dietary effects on LDL-cholesterol particle size warrant\nfurther investigations, especially with regard to establishing\nwhether some individuals can beneﬁt from one diet\nover another.\nSeveral studies showed that macronutrient composition did not\nseem to be the determining factorin the effectiveness of losing\nweight when energy intake is also decreased(14,29,36,38).L Cd i e t e r s\nreduced the energy intake upto 30 %, which was a signiﬁcant\nreduction compared with baseline intake and comparable with\nsubjects on the LF diet(11,27– 29,30,36,38).T h e s eﬁndings support the\nassumption that the weight loss observed among LC dieters is\nmainly due to reduction in energy intake rather than macronutrient\ncomposition(44,46). All the information available on energy intake in\nthe LC and LF groups is presented in Table 1. Unfortunately, there\nis a general lack of information detailing actual energy intake\nTable 3.

Our analyses included eleven studies for\nbody weight, TAG, HDL and LDL, but less than ten studies for\nTC, SBP, DBP, glucose and insulin, which may have resulted in\ntoo low power to detect asymmetry. However, the majority of\npublished meta-analyses contain ten or fewer studies(48). Third,\nthe high dropout rates of the included studies, with an average\nof 31 % for both the LC and LF groups must be taken into\nconsideration.

Seven studies in\nour meta-analysis reported the macronutrient consumption\nat the end of the intervention, where CHO intake ranged from\n9– 40 % of total energy intake(27,35). Furthermore, from studying\nthe data provided, LC dieters seemed to compensate with\nincreased fat intake, ranging from 37– 54 % of total energy at the\nend of the intervention, and generally a slight increase in\nprotein intake. It is clear that, although similar diets were\nprescribed at the outset, some differences in macronutrient\ncomposition are undoubtedly inevitable when subjects were not\ngiven any further directions in terms of dietary intake. The large\nvariations in the reported CHO intake (reﬂecting limited\nadherence) and differences in macronutrient composition could\nlimit the generalisability and validity of the presented data.

        "text": "macronutrient and energy settings were carefully imposed in\ndietary interventions, it is a limitation when subjects are left to\nreport the food intake themselves. In addition, collection of dietary\ndata differed between the included studies, and dietary assessment\nmethods have limitations and involve signiﬁcant measurements\nerrors, such as under-or over-reporting of certain types of foods,\npeople may forget to report certain foods or they report what is\nexpected rather than their actual food intake. This is and remains\none of the greatest limitations for all dietary interventions, and for\nthis meta-analysis it is not an exception. Some of the uncertainty\nmay, however, be reduced by including studies with approxi-\nmately the same macronutrient content at the outset, which has\nbeen attempted in this meta-analysis, reﬂected by the strict inclu-\nsion criteria with regard to CHO intake. Moreover, as the studies\nw e r ep e r f o r m e do no v e r w e i g h ti n dividuals, regarded as otherwise\nhealthy, the results may not be applicable to individuals with\nobesity-related conditions such as diabetes, CVD and disturbances\nin lipid metabolism. Finally, multiple testing was not adjusted for,\nb u te a c ha s s o c i a t i o nw a se v a l u a t e do ni t so w nm e r i t sa n dw i t h\nrespect to results in the literature.\nIn the present meta-analysis that included dietary interventions\non individuals with increased BMI, but regarded as otherwise as\nhealthy, we found a greater weight loss in subjects on the LC\ndiet compared with subjects on the LF diet, more favourable\nchanges in HDL-cholesterol and TAG levels and less favourable\nchanges in LDL-cholesterol levels. However, none of the studies\nexamined effects of the LC diet on hard end points, such as\nCHD and mortality, and it is therefore impossible to draw\nconclusions in this regard. Nevertheless, as LDL-cholesterol is\nhighly atherogenic, we raise the question whether LC diets may\nincrease morbidity and mortality in the long term. Thus, there is\na need for studies of longer duration investigating effects on\nhard end points. Further investigations are needed, and may\ncontribute to an improved understanding of the large variability\nin individual response to dietary intervention.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by The Throne Holst Foundation for\nNutrition Research and University of Oslo.\nK.
