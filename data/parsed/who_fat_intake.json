Dietary fat and fatty acids are important in human physiology but are also \nthe most energy dense of the macronutrients, and there has been extensive discussion of the potential \nimpact of the percentage of calories consumed as fat on body weight. Because the role of dietary fat in the \ndevelopment of overweight and obesity continues to be debated, it was considered important to review \nthe evidence in a systematic manner, and to update current WHO guidance on total fat through the WHO \nguideline development process.\nObjective, scope and methods\nThe objective of this guideline is to provide updated guidance on the intake of total fat, to be used by policy-\nmakers, programme managers, health professionals and other stakeholders in efforts to promote healthy \ndiets. The guidance was formulated based on evidence for unhealthy weight gain1 only. The guideline \nwas developed following the WHO guideline development process, as outlined in the WHO handbook \nfor guideline development. This process includes a review of systematically gathered evidence by an \ninternational, multidisciplinary group of experts; assessment of the quality of that evidence via the Grading \nof Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework; and consideration \nof additional, potentially mitigating factors 2 when translating the evidence into recommendations. The \nguidance in this guideline replaces previous WHO guidance on total fat intake, including that from the 1989 \nWHO Study Group on Diet, Nutrition and the Prevention of Chronic Diseases and the 2002 Joint WHO/FAO \nExpert Consultation on Diet, Nutrition and the Prevention of Chronic Diseases.\nThe evidence\nEvidence from a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in non-dieting adults \nfound that reducing intake of total fat led to lower body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference \nand percentage of body fat (high certainty evidence overall). Results of subgroup analyses and meta-\nregression suggest that greater reductions in total fat intake were associated with greater differences in \nbody weight, and that those consuming less than 30% of total energy intake as fat had less body fatness \nthan those consuming 30% or more of total energy intake as fat.

For the \ndevelopment of this guideline, unhealthy weight gain was assessed as an increase in, or greater measures of, body fatness \nas reported in the systematic reviews underpinning the recommendations.\n2 These include desirable and undesirable effects of the intervention, priority of the problem that the recommendations \naddress, values and preferences related to the recommendations in different settings, the cost of the options available \nto public health officials and programme managers in different settings, feasibility and acceptability of implementing the \nrecommendations in different settings, and the potential impact on equity and human rights.",

In fact, a small \nimprovement in total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and blood pressure was \nobserved with reduced fat intake.\nBecause of differences in methodology and data reporting across the studies, meta-analyses of identified \nprospective cohort studies could not be reliably conducted. Of the 39 reported analyses in 14 cohort studies \non the association between total fat intake and measures of body fatness in adults, 12 suggested a positive \nassociation, three suggested a negative association and one was unclear. The remaining 23 analyses did not \nshow statistically significant associations.1\nThree RCTs conducted in children were identified, but due to differential reporting of outcomes at different \npoints of follow-up they were not considered suitable for meta-analysis. Results of RCTs on measures of \nbody fatness were inconsistent but there was no suggestion of undesirable effects associated with reduced \nfat intake in terms of blood lipids or linear growth.\nRecommendations and supporting information\nThese recommendations should be considered in the context of other WHO guidelines on healthy \ndiets, including those on saturated fatty acids, trans-fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, sugars, \ncarbohydrates, non-sugar sweeteners, sodium and potassium.\n WHO recommendations\n1. To reduce the risk of unhealthy weight gain, WHO suggests that adults limit total fat intake to 30% \nof total energy intake or less (conditional recommendation)\n2. Fat consumed should be primarily unsaturated fatty acids, with no more than 10% of total energy \nintake coming from saturated fatty acids and no more than 1% of total energy intake coming from \ntrans-fatty acids (strong recommendation)\nRationale for recommendation 1 \n ▶ This recommendation is based on evidence of high certainty from a systematic review of RCTs of dietary \nfat reduction in adults in which weight loss was not an explicit goal. All measures of body fatness \nassessed in the review (i.e. body weight, BMI, waist circumference and percentage body fat) were \nlower in adult participants randomized to a lower fat intake versus usual or moderate intake, with the \nmost commonly reported measure being body weight. The evidence further suggests that the greater \nthe difference in fat intake between those reducing fat intake and those not doing so, the greater the \ndifference in body weight (i.e. a dose–response relationship), regardless of the final level of total fat \nintake achieved. Overall, the evidence suggests that a lower fat intake has the potential to help reduce \nthe risk of unhealthy weight gain.\n ▶ The threshold of 30% was selected because most of the trials included in the analyses reported total \nfat intakes of 30% or more at baseline (range: 29–43% of total energy intake) and most studies achieved \nintakes of 30% or less in the intervention arms (range: 14–35% of total energy intake). When compared \ndirectly via subgroup analysis, there was a greater difference in body weight in trials where total fat \nintake was reduced to a final level of less than 30% of total energy intake in the intervention arms than in \ntrials where total fat intake was reduced to a final level that was 30% of total energy intake or more in the \nintervention arms. In addition, the observed dose–response relationship indicates a cumulative effect \nof lower fat intake across the range of baseline intakes, with a greater reduction in fat intake resulting \nin a greater difference in body weight. Therefore, although an effect on body weight is anticipated with \n1 The evidence from cohort studies was reviewed but was not formally assessed for quality using GRADE methodology, given \nthe inability to pool the effects of the identified cohort studies via meta-analysis, that the qualitative results from the cohort \nstudies were consistent with those from the RCTs and that the data from the RCTs were robust and of higher certainty.",

It is therefore important to \nconsider this recommendation in the context of other WHO dietary recommendations, including those \non free sugars and carbohydrates, which provide guidance on carbohydrate quality. The evidence did \nnot suggest any undesirable effects with respect to serum lipids, blood pressure or quality of life from \nlower total fat intake, but rather of small benefits or no effect (all high certainty evidence, except for \nquality of life, which was assessed as low  certainty evidence). No mitigating factors were identified that \nwould argue against limiting total fat intake to 30% of total energy intake or less.\nRemarks for recommendation 1\n ▶ This recommendation is relevant for individuals aged 20 years or older.\n ▶ The goal in developing this guideline was to provide recommendations for both adults and children. \nHowever, the evidence was considered insufficient to support the formulation of a recommendation for \nchildren owing to the limited number of studies and inconsistent results identified for children, and the \nconclusion that the adult data could not reasonably be extrapolated to children given the unique energy \nrequirements for optimal growth and development throughout childhood and adolescence. Previous \nexpert consultations on dietary fats have concluded that for children aged 6  months and above and \nadolescents, total fat intakes of up to 35% of total energy are appropriate to meet growth demands \nwithout leading to excess energy intake.1\n ▶ The threshold of 30% in this recommendation should not be interpreted as an upper value of intake to \nbe achieved by increasing fat intake among those with nutritionally adequate total fat intakes that are \nalready less than 30% of total energy intake.\n ▶ Evaluation of the evidence suggests that the observed effect of reducing total fat intake on measures \nof body fatness is mediated, at least in part, by dietary behaviours that affect energy balance. In most \ntrials, those who reduced their total fat intake also decreased their total energy intake (even though that \nwas not intended in the trial design), and this led to decreasing weight. This finding suggests that there \nmay be a tendency for those habitually consuming greater amounts of total fat to also consume more \nenergy than needed, resulting in excess energy intake and subsequent weight gain. However, individuals \nwho can maintain energy balance (or otherwise prevent excess energy intake) at higher fat intakes may \nbe able to consume total fat at levels greater than 30% of total energy intake without increasing their \nrisk of unhealthy weight gain.\n ▶ The scope of this guideline was limited to developing recommendations for the prevention of unhealthy \nweight gain, not for the management of existing overweight or obesity. Therefore, studies conducted \nwith overweight participants actively pursuing weight loss (i.e. “weight loss studies”) were not included \nin the systematic review used to inform the recommendation. The recommendation may therefore not \napply to individuals actively pursuing weight loss through modification of the diet, although current \nevidence does suggest that lower fat, restricted-calorie diets may be one of several effective, short-term \nstrategies for losing excess body weight.\n ▶ This recommendation should not be interpreted as implying that total fat is the only risk factor for \nunhealthy weight gain and that reducing total fat intake alone is sufficient to prevent unhealthy weight \ngain. The etiology of unhealthy weight gain is complex and can involve many different inputs. Therefore, \nthis recommendation should be considered in the context of other relevant WHO guidance, including \nthat on the intake of free sugars, carbohydrates, non-sugar sweeteners, energy requirements and \nphysical activity.\n1 Infants should be exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months of life to achieve optimal growth, development and health. \nThereafter, to meet their evolving nutritional requirements, infants should receive nutritionally adequate and safe \ncomplementary foods, while continuing to breastfeed for up to 2 years or beyond.\nExecutive summary",

In 2020, more than 38 million children under 5 years of age were overweight – an increase \nof nearly 6 million since 2000 (2). High body mass index (BMI) was responsible for an estimated 4 million \ndeaths in 2015 (3) , with greater increases in BMI in the overweight and obesity range leading to a greater \nrisk of mortality (4) . Obesity is also a risk factor for many noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) including \ncardiovascular diseases (CVDs), type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancers. NCDs are the leading causes \nof death globally and were responsible for an estimated 41 million (71%) of the 55 million deaths in 2019 (5). \nObesity and certain NCDs also increase the likelihood of becoming severely ill from COVID-19 infection (6–8).\nAmong other lifestyle and dietary factors, macronutrient distribution of the diet (i.e. the percentage of \ncarbohydrates, protein and fats) has been explored as a possible contributor to unhealthy weight gain,2 \nwhich may in turn lead to the development of overweight and obesity. Although BMI is increasing in almost \nevery country, rates of overweight and obesity are growing most rapidly in low- and middle-income \ncountries (LMICs) (15–17) – settings where undernutrition is also still widely prevalent – thus fuelling growth \nof the double burden of malnutrition (18) . Concurrent with this increase in unhealthy weight gain is a \ntransition to diets higher in fat, salt and sugars (i.e. the “nutrition transition”), which has been extensively \ndocumented over the past two decades in numerous LMICs (19–23). Although the causes of increasing rates \nof overweight and obesity in LMICs are many and varied, an increase in total fat intake (primarily through \nincreased consumption of animal fat and vegetable oils) has been described as a potential contributor (20, \n24–28).\nFats consumed by humans are generally in the form of triglycerides, which comprise three fatty acids \nattached to a glycerol molecule. The percentage of fat in the diet can be referred to as “total fat” and is the \nsum of all dietary fats, comprising monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, saturated fatty acids \nand trans-fatty acids (without distinguishing between the different types of fat in terms of any associated \nhealth effects). Common sources of fat in the human diet are meat, fish, dairy products, plant- and animal-\nbased oils and fats, nuts and seeds and highly processed foods.\nIn addition to being an important source of energy in the diet, fats and fatty acids play various roles in \nhuman physiology. They serve as a carrier for the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K, and support their \n1 Overweight and obesity are defined as follows:\n Children (<5 years):\n •\t Overweight:\tweight\tfor\theight\t>+2\tstandard\tdeviations\t(SD)\tof\tthe\tWorld\tHealth\tOrganization\t(WHO)\tchild\tgrowth\tstandards\t \n median\n School-aged children and adolescents (5–19 years):\n •\tOverweight:\tBMI-for-age\t>+1 SD\tof\tthe\tWHO\tgrowth\treference\tfor\tschool-aged\tchildren\tand\tadolescents\t(equivalent\tto\tBMI \n 25 kg/m 2 at 19 years)\n •\tObesity:\t>+2 SD\tof\tthe\tWHO\tgrowth\treference\tfor\tschool-aged\tchildren\tand\tadolescents\t(equivalent\tto\tBMI\t30 kg/m 2 at  \n 19 years)\n Adults (≥20 years):\n Overweight: BMI ≥25 kg/m 2\n Obesity: BMI ≥30 kg/m 2\n2 In this context, unhealthy weight gain refers to unintentional weight gain (i.e. increase in body fatness) that contributes \nto the progression towards overweight and obesity, but excludes appropriate weight gain during pregnancy (9, 10) and as \npart of normal growth and development in childhood (11) .

Thus, higher fat intakes can lead to increased \ntotal energy intake (31–41), which in turn may lead to energy imbalance and unhealthy weight gain (42–44) .\nSeveral recent studies have shown either no association between higher fat diets consisting predominantly \nof unsaturated fat of plant origin and weight gain, or decreased risk of weight gain (45–48), suggesting \nthat quality of dietary fat may also be a factor in the impact of dietary fat on body weight. Additionally, \nevidence for the role that percentage of fat in the diet may play in helping to reach and maintain a healthy \nbody weight in individuals actively pursuing weight loss is inconsistent, with some studies reporting lower \nbody weight with higher fat diets, others reporting lower body weight with lower fat diets, and still others \nreporting equivalent weight loss regardless of fat percentage when total energy intake is reduced (49–54).\nDespite longstanding dietary advice to limit total fat intake because of its potential role in the risk of \ndeveloping NCDs as well as overweight and obesity, fat intake remains high in many parts of the world (55), \nexceeding values recommended by several expert meetings and consultations convened by World Health \nOrganization (WHO) including the 2002 Joint WHO/Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations \n(FAO) Expert Consultation on Diet, Nutrition and the Prevention of Chronic Diseases (56) . Furthermore, \nemerging evidence suggests a potential future trend of increasing fat intake in the near term (57) .\nRationale\nFollowing the work of the 1989 WHO Study Group on Diet, Nutrition and Prevention of Noncommunicable \nDiseases (58), the 2002 Joint WHO/FAO Expert Consultation on Diet, Nutrition and the Prevention of Chronic \nDiseases updated the guidance on total fat intake as part of the guidance on population nutrient intake \ngoals for the prevention of NCDs (56). In 2008, the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on Fats and Fatty \nAcids in Human Nutrition (59)  concluded that there was little evidence to suggest a link between total \nfat intake and coronary heart disease or cancer. However, as a result of limited evidence and conflicting \ninterpretations of the results regarding an association between total fat intake and body weight, the Expert \nConsultation was unable to reach a consensus conclusion; therefore, it maintained the recommended level \nof total fat intake established by the 2002 Joint WHO/FAO Expert Consultation on Diet, Nutrition and the \nPrevention of Chronic Diseases (56). The consultation noted that further research was needed, including a \nsystematic review of available evidence on the effects of total fat intake on body weight, to develop globally \napplicable guidance on total fat intake.\nSince that time, rates of overweight and obesity have continued to climb, and numerous studies and \nanalyses of fat intake have been published, particularly in relation to a possible role in unhealthy weight gain. \nConsequently, the debate has continued as to whether the available evidence supports recommendations \nto lower or limit total fat intake. In addition, there has been a general transition to diets higher in fat, salt \nand sugars in many of the same LMICs (19–22)  where overweight and obesity have become a major public \nhealth concern (15, 16) . Evidence suggests that increased total fat intake (primarily through increased \nconsumption of animal fat and vegetable oils) may be a contributor to increasing rates of overweight and \nobesity in LMICs (20, 24–27). Consequently, there has been great interest from Member States in addressing \nunhealthy weight gain in their populations through a variety of evidence-informed policies and actions. \nTherefore, it was considered important to review the existing evidence for total fat intake in the context \nof body fatness in a systematic manner, and update WHO’s guidance on total fat intake through the WHO \nguideline development process.",

        "text": "3\nScope\nThis guideline is part of the larger effort to update the population nutrient intake goals for the prevention of \nNCDs established in by the 2002 Joint WHO/FAO Expert Consultation on Diet, Nutrition and the Prevention \nof Chronic Diseases (56). The focus of this guideline is on total fat intake and its effects on body fatness. It \ncovers only the prevention of unhealthy weight gain and not the management of existing overweight or \nobesity. The recommendation on level of total fat intake in this guideline (recommendation 1) is intended \nfor the general adult population. Owing to limited evidence, it was not possible to recommend a level of \ntotal fat intake for children. Recommendation 2 is intended for children and adults as indicated in the \nRemarks for recommendation 2. The guidance in this guideline replaces previous WHO guidance on total \nfat intake, including that from the 1989 WHO Study Group on Diet, Nutrition and the Prevention of Chronic \nDiseases (58) and the 2002 Joint WHO/FAO Expert Consultation on Diet, Nutrition and the Prevention of \nChronic Diseases (56).\nObjective\nThe objective of this guideline is to provide guidance on the intake of total fat as it relates to measures of \nbody fatness. This is in recognition of the rapidly growing epidemic of obesity around the globe and its \nrole as a risk factor for various NCDs. An additional key consideration of this guideline regarding risk of \nNCDs is to convey that the total amount of dietary fat (quantity) and the composition of dietary fat (quality) \nare tightly linked in their effects on health and are thus both important for overall guidance on dietary fat \nintake. Therefore, although quality of dietary fat is covered by other WHO guidance (56), it was considered \nimportant to communicate guidance on both quantity and quality of dietary fat in this guideline.\nUpdating the WHO recommendations for total fat intake is an important element of WHO’s efforts in \nimplementing the NCD agenda and achieving the “triple billion” targets set by the 13th General Programme \nof Work (2019–2023), including 1 billion more people enjoying better health and well-being. In addition, the \nrecommendations and other elements of this guideline will support:\n ▶ implementation of the political declarations of the United Nations (UN) high-level meetings on the \nprevention and control of NCDs held in New York in 2011 and 2018, and the outcome document of the \nhigh-level meeting of the UN General Assembly on NCDs (A/RES/68/300) held in New York in July 2014;\n ▶ implementation of the WHO Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable \nDiseases 2013–2030, which was adopted by the 66th World Health Assembly held in May 2013 (the \ntimeline was extended to 2030 at the 72nd World Health Assembly held in May 2019);\n ▶ implementation of the recommendations of the high-level Commission on Ending Childhood Obesity \nestablished by the WHO Director-General in May 2014;\n ▶ Member States in implementing the commitments of the Rome Declaration on Nutrition and \nrecommended actions in the Framework for Action, including a set of policy options and strategies \nto promote diversified, safe and healthy diets at all stages of life – these were adopted by the Second \nInternational Conference on Nutrition (ICN2) in 2014 and endorsed by the 136th Session of the WHO \nExecutive Board held in January 2015 and the 68th World Health Assembly held in May 2015, which called \non Member States to implement the commitments of the Rome Declaration across multiple sectors;\n ▶ achievement of the goals of the UN Decade of Action on Nutrition (2016–2025), declared by the UN \nGeneral Assembly in April 2016, which include increased action at the national, regional and global levels \nto achieve the commitments of the Rome Declaration, through implementing policy options included in \nthe Framework for Action and evidence-informed programme actions; and\n ▶ the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, \nparticularly Goal 2 (Zero hunger) and Goal 3 (Good health and well-being).\nIntroduction",

        "text": "7\nDefining key questions and prioritizing outcomes\nBased on the outcomes of the 2008 Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on Fats and Fatty Acids in Human \nNutrition (59), requests from Member States to examine the evidence for the effects of total fat intake on body \nweight, and reviews of the scientific literature, WHO developed an initial set of questions to be addressed \nin the guideline and one outcome of interest on unhealthy weight gain1 (as assessed by various measures \nof body fatness including body weight, BMI, waist circumference, skinfold thickness and percentage body \nfat). The questions were based primarily on the needs of Member States and international partners for \npolicy and programme guidance. The population, intervention, comparison and outcome (PICO) format \nwas used in generating the questions (Annex 5). The PICO questions were first discussed and reviewed by \nthe WHO Secretariat and the NUGAG Subgroup on Diet and Health, and were then made available for public \ncomment.\nThe key questions that guided the systematic reviews undertaken are as follows.\n ▶ What is the effect of reduced intake of total fat on measures of body fatness in adults?\n ▶ What is the effect of reduced intake of total fat on measures of body fatness in children?\nEvidence gathering and review\nTwo systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective cohort studies were \ncommissioned to assess the effects of modifying intake of total dietary fat on unhealthy weight gain, as \nassessed by measures of body fatness in adults and children.\n ▶ A systematic review of RCTs and prospective cohort studies conducted in adults last updated in 2020 \n(13). This update was limited to RCTs, because the data for prospective cohort studies obtained in the \noriginal review (12)  were too varied to synthesize and therefore did not provide useful information \nbeyond that obtained from the RCTs.\n ▶ A systematic review of RCTs and prospective cohort studies conducted in children and published in 2018 \n(14). A subsequent scan of the literature covering the date the literature was searched for the original \nreview through May 2021 was conducted and nothing was identified that would significantly change the \nresults or conclusions of the original review. Therefore, this systematic review was not formally updated.\nAssessment of certainty in the evidence\nGRADE2 methodology was used to assess the certainty in the evidence (i.e. confidence in) identified in the \nsystematic reviews. GRADE assessments assigned by the systematic review teams were discussed by the \nNUGAG Subgroup on Diet and Health and the systematic review teams, and refined as necessary under the \nguidance of a methodologist with extensive expertise in GRADE methodology. When assessing the overall \ncertainty in the evidence for body fatness or undesirable effects, which consisted of several component \noutcomes, the certainty for each component outcome was assessed individually. Where all component \noutcomes showed the same direction of effect, the overall certainty in the main outcome was taken to be \nthe highest certainty of the individual component outcome(s) which alone would be sufficient to base a \nrecommendation on. GRADE assessments are summarized in Annex 6.\n1 Unhealthy weight gain was selected as the priority outcome for the development of this guideline owing to conclusions drawn \nand recommendations made by the 2008 Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on Fats and Fatty Acids in Human Nutrition \n(“Expert Consultation”) (59). The Expert Consultation concluded that from the available evidence reviewed at the time of \nthe consultation there was little evidence to suggest a link between total fat intake and coronary heart disease or cancer. \nHowever, as a result of limited evidence and conflicting interpretation of the results regarding an association between total \nfat intake and body fatness, the Expert Consultation was unable to reach a consensus conclusion and therefore maintained \nthe recommended level of total fat intake established by the 2002 Joint WHO/FAO Expert Consultation on Diet, Nutrition and \nthe Prevention of Chronic Diseases (56). It was also noted that further research was needed, including a systematic review \nof available evidence on the effects of total fat intake on body fatness, to develop globally applicable guidance on total fat \nintake. Therefore, in developing the WHO guideline on total fat intake, including the undertaking of a new systematic review, \nthe NUGAG Subgroup on Diet and Health focused on unhealthy weight gain (as an indication of unhealthy increase in body \nfatness) as the priority outcome. \n2 See http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/ \nHow this guideline was developed",

Because the focus of this guideline is on prevention of unhealthy weight gain, and \nnot on the management of existing overweight or obesity, trials were excluded from the systematic review \nif the aim was intentional weight loss of participants in the intervention arm, or if participants were selected \nfor higher body weight, BMI or body weight classification (as most appeared to have weight loss goals, even \nwhen this was not explicitly stated).1 Trials with participants of mixed body weights (including those with \noverweight and obesity) that met the other inclusion criteria were included. Only trials in which the dietary \nintervention lasted at least 6 months were included in the review (trial duration ranged from 6 months to \nmore than 8 years).\nThe systematic review included 37 RCTs with over 57 000 participants. Of these, 24 were conducted in North \nAmerica, 10 in Europe, two in Australia and New Zealand, and one in China. In four trials the participants \nwere all men, in 16 all women, and in 17 both sexes (one of which reported outcomes separately by sex). \nMean ages and states of health (i.e. low, moderate or high risk of CVDs or breast cancer) varied. In the \nincluded trials, intervention arms consisted of participants who reduced total fat intake as a percentage of \ntotal energy intake (“reduced fat arms”) as a result of interventions including the receipt of dietary advice \nor provision of food (i.e. either supplementation with fats, oils or modified or low-fat foods, or a complete \ndiet), and control arms consisted of participants who retained their usual fat intake (i.e. did not receive a \nreduced fat intervention). Total fat intake at baseline was 29–43% of total energy intake. Achieved intakes \nof total dietary fat were 14–35% of total energy intake across intervention and control arms of the trials.\nBody weight\nMeta-analysis of RCTs found that reducing total fat intake resulted in a lower body weight in reduced fat \narms compared with control arms2 (mean difference [MD] –1.42 kg; 95% confidence interval [CI]: –1.73 to \n–1.10; 26 trials/33 comparisons with 53 875 participants). The effect on body weight was consistent across \nthe trials, with a lower body weight in reduced fat arms reported in 30 of the 33 comparisons included in the \n1 Such trials were potentially confounded by the implicit objective of reducing energy intake to produce weight loss and might \ntherefore lead to an overemphasis on trials carried out exclusively in highly selected overweight and obese populations, \nwhich may have limited applicability in non-overweight populations, including those in some LMICs. The decision to exclude \nstudies with intentional weight loss goals was carefully considered because it was realized that doing so would exclude \nmany studies assessing the effect of reducing total fat intake on body weight. However, it was determined that the inclusion \nof studies with intentional weight loss would not only skew the analysis to highly selected overweight and obese individuals \nbut would also likely introduce bias that would decrease confidence in the results. This is because weight loss studies \nconducted in free-living individuals are frequently confounded by numerous, complex behavioural factors, including \nvariability in motivation to adhere to a particular diet over time – which can be influenced by popular perception of its \nefficacy – as well as guilt if participants are unsuccessful in adhering to a particular diet, both of which could affect reporting \nof dietary intake. Results of weight loss studies in some cases could therefore reflect popularity of a particular diet more so \nthan the body weight-altering effects of the macronutrients contained therein (61).\n2 The differences in measures of body fatness reported at the conclusion of the individual trials varied in terms of how the \ndifference was achieved. In some trials, the relative reduction in body weight was due to a smaller increase in body weight \nover time in the reduced fat arms than in the control arms, and in others, body weight was reduced in the intervention arms \nbut decreased by less, stayed the same or increased in the control arms.",

In addition, nine trials, for which an estimable effect size could not be extracted due to lack \nof variance data or large baseline differences (and therefore did not contribute to the pooled effect), were \nconsistent with lower body weights in the reduced fat arms compared with the control arms.\nThe effect of reducing total fat intake on body weight remained statistically significant in sensitivity \nanalyses, including the exclusion of trials that:\n ▶ reported systematic differences in care; that is, greater time or resources were provided to the reduced \nfat arm than to the control arm (MD –0.89 kg; 95% CI: –1.17 to –0.60);\n ▶ included additional dietary interventions to that of reducing total dietary fat intake 1 (MD –1.63 kg; 95% \nCI: –2.07 to –1.19); or\n ▶ had potential compliance problems (MD –1.56 kg; 95% CI: –1.88 to –1.23).\nThe effect body weight also remained statistically significant in sensitivity analyses when:\n ▶ the largest trial (62) was excluded (MD –1.51 kg; 95% CI: –1.86 to –1.15);\n ▶ included trials were limited to those with the lowest summary risk of bias 2 (MD –0.67 kg; 95% CI: –0.82 \nto –0.52); or\n ▶ the data were analysed with a fixed-effects model rather than a random-effects model (MD –0.94 kg; \n95% CI: –1.05 to –0.82).\nResults of meta-regression analysis suggested that the magnitude of the difference in body weight was \npositively correlated with the magnitude of reduction in total fat intake, with greater reduction in total fat \nintake associated with greater differences in body weight (i.e. a dose–response relationship). The regression \nmodel indicates that for each 1% reduction in total fat intake, there is a decrease in body weight of 0.20 kg \n(95% CI: –0.34 to –0.06; P = 0.007), which suggests that any level of reduction in total fat intake is likely to \nresult in some reduction in unhealthy weight gain. Results of prespecified subgroup analyses were further \nsuggestive of a dose–response relationship between the magnitude of reduction in total fat intake and the \nmagnitude of the difference in body weight, with the difference in body weight observed for differences in \ntotal fat intakes between reduced fat and control arms of:\n ▶ 5% to less than 10% of total energy intake (MD –1.76 kg; 95% CI: –2.25 to –1.28);\n ▶ 10% to less than 15% of total energy intake (MD –1.23 kg; 95% CI: –1.72 to –0.74); and\n ▶ 15% of total energy intake or more (MD –3.91 kg; 95% CI: –7.61 to –0.22);\nbeing greater than the difference in body weight observed for a difference of less than 5% of total energy \nintake between reduced fat and control arms, which was not statistically significant (MD –0.15 kg; 95% CI: \n–0.77 to 0.47) (test for subgroup differences P = 0.0005). Results of subgroup analyses further suggested \ngreater difference in body weight in those achieving a total fat intake of 30% of total energy or less (MD \n–1.55  kg; 95% CI: –1.93 to –1.18), compared with those who did not achieve that target (i.e. achieved a \ntotal fat intake of more than 30% of total energy) (MD –0.90 kg; 95% CI: –1.32 to –0.47) (test for subgroup \ndifferences P = 0.02).\nResults of subgroup analyses also indicated greater differences in body weight with greater reductions in \ntotal energy intake in the reduced fat arms of the trials, suggesting that the effect of lowering total fat \nintake on body weight might be mediated in part by a reduction in total energy intake – noting however, \nthat dietary intake data from many studies included in the review are not robust and therefore reported \nenergy intakes may not be precise. The difference in body weight between reduced fat and control arms \nwas greater when energy intake was reduced in the reduced fat arm by:\n ▶ 1–100 kcal per day (MD –1.04 kg; 95% CI: –1.68 to –0.41);\n ▶ 101–200 kcal per day (MD –0.74 kg; 95% CI: –1.38 to –0.10); or\n ▶ more than 200 kcal per day (MD –2.22 kg; 95% CI: –2.83 to –1.61);\n1 As an example, trials in which the intervention arm was advised to reduce total dietary fat intake and also encouraged to \nconsume fruits and vegetables, compared with just being encouraged to consume fruits and vegetables in the control arm.\n2 Trials with low risk of selection bias (low risk from random sequence generation and allocation concealment) and low risk of \ndetection bias.",

However, because the RCTs reported different outcomes at different follow-up points, the studies were \nconsidered unsuitable for meta-analysis.\nInterventions included family-based and school-based dietary advice and counselling. As the focus of \nthis guideline is on prevention of unhealthy weight gain, and not on the management of overweight and \nobesity, trials in which the interventions were designed to result in intentional weight loss of participants, \nas well as trials where participants were chosen for raised body weight, BMI or body weight classification \n(as most appeared to have weight loss goals, even when this was not explicitly stated), were excluded. Only \ntrials in which the dietary intervention lasted at least 6 months were included in the review (trial duration \nwas 1–7 years). All three RCTs compared children with lower total fat intake (30% or less of their total daily \nenergy) to children with usual or modified fat intake (more than 30% of their total daily energy). One trial \nwas conducted in Greece and two in the United States of America. Overall, one RCT found that reduced \nintake of total fat resulted in decreased BMI over 1 year of follow-up, while a second found no effect on BMI \nwith up to 7 years of follow-up. One RCT found no difference in body weight with reduced fat intake with \nup to 7 years of follow-up and another found no difference in weight-for-age z-scores at 1 year of follow-up.\nMeasures of body fatness\nThe VYRONAS trial randomized 218 students aged 12–13  years at baseline and with no known CVD risk \nfactors to a 12-week school-based health and nutrition interventional programme or usual care, with a \n1-year follow-up period (65). Total fat intake in the intervention arm decreased significantly (P < 0.001) while \nin the control arm it did not. At 1 year of follow-up, mean BMI (adjusting for age and sex) in the intervention \narm was 1.5 kg/m2 lower than the control arm (95% CI: –2.45 to –0.55; 191 participants).\nThe Dietary Intervention Study in Children (DISC) randomized 663 boys and girls aged 7–11  years at \nbaseline with elevated serum LDL cholesterol levels to a nutrition counselling programme or usual care \nwith a focus on specifically reducing saturated fatty acid intake, with up to 7  years of follow-up (66). At \n3 years of follow-up, total fat intake in the intervention arm was significantly lower than in the control arm  \n(P < 0.01). No significant difference was reported for body weight at 1 year of follow-up (MD –0.50 kg; 95% CI: \n–1.78 to 0.78; 620 participants) or 3 years of follow-up (MD –0.60 kg; 95% CI: –2.39 to 1.19; 612 participants), \nor for BMI at 1 year of follow-up (MD –0.30 kg/m2; 95% CI: –0.75 to 0.15; 620 participants), 3 years of follow-up \n(MD 0.0 kg/m2; 95% CI: –0.63 to 0.63; 541 participants), or at the last visit (approximately 7 years of follow-up)  \n(MD –0.10 kg/m2; 95% CI: –0.75 to 0.55; 576 participants).\nThe Children’s Health Project randomized 271 boys and girls aged 4–11  years with elevated serum LDL \ncholesterol levels to a nutrition counselling programme or usual care with 1  year of follow-up (67). No \nsignificant difference between intervention and control arms was observed for weight-for-age z -scores at \n1 year of follow-up (MD –0.18; 95% CI: –0.51 to 0.15; 151 participants).\nThe overall certainty in the available evidence for an effect of reducing total fat intake on BMI and body \nweight in children was assessed as low, and for weight-for-age z-score it was assessed as very low .\nPotential undesirable effects\nThe evidence did not suggest any undesirable effects of reducing total fat intake with respect to blood \nlipids, rather it suggested a small benefit or no effect. Compared with usual fat intake, reduced total fat \nintake resulted in small reductions in total cholesterol (MD –0.15  mmol/L; 95% CI: –0.24 to –0.06; 618 \nparticipants; moderate certainty) at 1  year of follow-up, and LDL cholesterol at 1  year of follow-up (MD \nSummary of evidence",

However, forthcoming WHO guidelines will provide specific guidance \non nutrition labelling policies, policies on marketing of food and non-alcoholic beverages to children, fiscal \nand pricing policies, and school food and nutrition policies, which will enable policy-makers to translate \ndietary goals into evidence-informed policies. 1 Therefore, in assessing the factors relevant to translating \nthe evidence into recommendations for this guideline, the NUGAG Subgroup on Diet and Health primarily \nconsidered each recommendation in the context of achieving the recommended dietary goals.\nEvidence for this process was gathered via comprehensive searches of relevant scientific databases and \nidentification of high-quality studies, including recent systematic reviews, where available. An evidence to \nrecommendation table can be found in Annex 7.2\nOverall certainty in the evidence\nThe certainty in the effects for body weight, BMI and waist circumference was assessed as high , and for \npercentage of body fat as moderate. Because beneficial effects were observed for all outcomes, the overall \ncertainty was assessed as high. There was high certainty in the evidence for all outcomes related to potential \nundesirable effects, except for quality of life, which was as assessed as low . Because no undesirable effects \nwere observed, the overall certainty was as assessed as high .\nBalance of desirable and undesirable effects\nAlthough the effects observed for body measures of body fatness were small to modest in magnitude, \nthey were highly significant and resistant to sensitivity analyses. No undesirable effects were observed as \nmeasured by blood lipids, blood pressure and quality of life; in fact, small improvements were observed \nfor total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and blood pressure. The effect observed for body fatness is expected \nto make a positive impact on unhealthy weight gain, particularly when paired with other healthy diet \nand lifestyle interventions. Therefore, as reviewed directly in this body of evidence, the desirable effects \nstrongly outweighed the non-existent undesirable effects. However, the NUGAG Subgroup on Diet and \nHealth acknowledged that some individuals who reduce their fat intake might replace some of the energy \n1 https://www.who.int/groups/nutrition-guidance-expert-advisory-group-(nugag)/policy-actions\n2 Evidence to recommendation information is summarized in this section only for recommendation 1.

Unhealthy eating patterns have been documented in many settings and pose a significant \nand growing public health problem, particularly in many LMICs (70). It was also noted that reducing total fat \nintake might lead to undesirable effects in those who are undernourished. Therefore, special consideration \nmust be given to undernourished individuals and in some such cases the recommendations may not \nbe appropriate. However, in the general population it was felt that the balance between desirable and \nundesirable effects favours the intervention.\nPriority of the problem and values and preferences\nThese recommendations address overweight and obesity by way of unhealthy weight gain. Overweight and \nobesity are highly prevalent and increasing globally, particularly in LMICs (15–17); therefore, interventions \nto prevent unhealthy weight gain are valuable in all contexts and preventing unhealthy weight gain is a high \npriority for many countries. Despite the rising global prevalence of overweight and obesity, the priority \nplaced on this problem by national authorities may vary depending on the real or perceived magnitude \nof the problem within each country. However, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the importance \nof prevention of overweight and obesity has been highlighted because there is increasing recognition of \nobesity as an important, independent prognostic factor and COVID-19 patients with obesity are at increased \nrisk for adverse outcomes (71).\nThe recommendations in this guideline place a high value on reducing unhealthy weight gain because it \nmay contribute to reducing the prevalence of overweight and obesity, which will not only increase the risk \nof various NCDs, but also the severity of COVID-19. While individuals almost universally value the prevention \nof premature mortality, those that may be affected by the recommendation may value the benefit of \nreducing risk of obesity and associated disease differently based on personal preferences, beliefs and \ncustoms. For example, because CVDs are a high profile public health topic, including in many LMICs where \nthey represent a growing threat (72), it is expected that most individuals would value efforts to reduce risk; \nhowever, in real-world settings, perception of the risk varies considerably (73–77) and may require outreach \nand communication efforts to improve understanding. Similarly, although many people in LMICs are \nincreasingly aware of the negative health effects associated with being overweight or obese, some cultures \nstill consider overweight to be a desirable or positive attribute (78–80). Others believe body weight to be \nhereditary and therefore not amenable to management via lifestyle changes (77, 81) . And many, regardless \nof personal beliefs, incorrectly perceive their own body weight in the context of overweight and obesity \n(i.e. they believe they are at a healthy body weight when in fact they are overweight or obese according to \naccepted standards for assessing body weight outcomes) (77, 81, 82).\nFeasibility\nIn settings where efforts to reduce total fat intake are planned or are already underway, feasibility should \nbe much higher than in settings where plans are not yet in place. Regardless, feasibility will be influenced \nby the existing, relevant infrastructure (for different interventions) and resources available. In terms of \nimplementing interventions to affect the desired change in total fat intake (e.g. behaviour change and \neducation campaigns, fiscal policies, marketing and labelling policies, and reformulation), feasibility will \nvary widely and detailed discussions of feasibility for each are beyond the scope of this guideline.\nRelevant to all interventions, widespread use and availability of certain food items high in fat may pose \nchallenges in decreasing consumption where necessary to meet the recommended intake. Regardless \nof which interventions are employed to realize the recommended fat intake, some amount of behaviour \nchange at the individual level will be required. This may be challenging in some settings, particularly those \nin which popular opinion has currently been shaped to view high fat intake as healthy, particularly with \nrespect to losing weight or maintaining a healthy body weight (83).",

As noted with respect to feasibility, however, \nthere are many for whom the recommendation will not be acceptable based on the popular perception that \nhigh fat diets are healthy, particularly with respect to losing weight or maintaining a healthy body weight \n(83).\nEquity and human rights\nThe recommendations in this guideline have the potential to reduce health inequity by improving the \nhealth of those of lower socioeconomic status because they are generally disproportionately affected by \noverweight and obesity. However, the effect on equity and human rights will probably be affected by how \nthe recommendations are translated into policies and actions (e.g. fiscal policies and reformulation). The \nimpact of some previously mentioned interventions on the pricing of manufactured foods would require \ncareful consideration, because any increase in costs borne by manufacturers might be passed on to the \nconsumer, which would be likely to disproportionately affect those of lower socioeconomic status.\nIn addition, a reduction in total fat intake may have different impacts on diets depending on what the nature \nof the dietary fat is in average diets in different settings. For example, in some settings, dietary fat may \nconsist largely of unsaturated fatty acids and a reduction in total fat intake may have an impact on body \nweight but not CVDs. In settings where dietary fat consists largely of saturated fatty acids or trans-fatty \nacids, a reduction in total fat intake may have an impact on both body weight and CVDs. Because saturated \nfatty acids and trans-fatty acids may make up a larger percentage of total fat intake in some LMICs (84) , in \nthose settings reducing total fat intake might result in health benefits both in terms of body weight and \ncardiovascular health.\nResource implications\nCosts of translating the recommendations into polices and actions will vary widely, depending on which \napproaches are taken, but will probably be associated with long-term savings in costs of health care. \nThe extent of these savings and resource use depends on the strategies chosen for implementation and \nthe timescale for evaluation. Implementation of the recommendations will probably require consumer \neducation and public health communications, some or all of which can be incorporated into existing public \nhealth nutrition education campaigns and other existing nutrition programmes at the global, regional, \nnational and subnational levels.\nEvidence to recommendations",

An explanation of the \nstrength of WHO recommendations can be found in Box 1 .\n WHO recommendations\n1. To reduce the risk of unhealthy weight gain, WHO suggests that adults limit total fat intake to 30% \nof total energy intake or less (conditional recommendation).\n2. Fat consumed should be primarily unsaturated fatty acids, with no more than 10% of total energy \nintake coming from saturated fatty acids and no more than 1% of total energy intake coming from \ntrans-fatty acids (strong recommendation).\nRationale for recommendation 1 \n ▶ This recommendation is based on evidence of high certainty from a systematic review of RCTs of dietary \nfat reduction in adults in which weight loss was not an explicit goal (13) . All measures of body fatness \nassessed in the review (i.e. body weight, BMI, waist circumference and percentage body fat) were \nlower in adult participants randomized to a lower fat intake versus usual or moderate intake2, with the \nmost commonly reported measure being body weight. The evidence further suggests that the greater \nthe difference in fat intake between those reducing fat intake and those not doing so, the greater the \ndifference in body weight (i.e. a dose–response relationship), regardless of the final level of total fat \nintake achieved. Overall, the evidence suggests that a lower fat intake has the potential to help reduce \nthe risk of unhealthy weight gain. 3\n ▶ The threshold of 30% was selected because most of the trials included in the analyses reported total \nfat intakes of 30% or more at baseline (range: 29–43% of total energy intake) and most studies achieved \nintakes of 30% or less in the intervention arms (range: 14–35% of total energy intake). When compared \ndirectly via subgroup analysis, there was a greater difference in body weight in trials where total fat \nintake was reduced to a final level of less than 30% of total energy intake in the intervention arms than in \ntrials where total fat intake was reduced to a final level that was 30% of total energy intake or more in the \nintervention arms. In addition, the observed dose–response relationship indicates a cumulative effect \nof lower fat intake across the range of baseline intakes, with a greater reduction in fat intake resulting \nin a greater difference in body weight. Therefore, although an effect on body weight is anticipated with \nreducing total fat intake regardless of the level of total fat intake achieved, the greatest effect may be \nachieved with a reduction to 30% of total energy intake or less.\n1 WHO guidance on polyunsaturated fatty acids is currently being updated.\n2 The differences in measures of body fatness reported at the end of the individual trials reflect lower body fatness in the \nlower fat intervention arms compared with the usual or moderate fat intake groups. In some trials, this was due to a smaller \nincrease in body weight over time in the lower fat intervention arms than in the control arms, and in others, body weight \ndecreased in the intervention arms but decreased by less, stayed the same or increased in the control arms.\n3 Given the inability to pool the effects of the identified cohort studies via meta-analysis, the qualitative results from the cohort \nstudies being not inconsistent with those from the RCTs, and the data from the RCTs being robust and of higher certainty, the \nevidence from cohort studies was reviewed, but was not formally assessed for quality using GRADE methodology or directly \nused in decision-making with respect to formulating the recommendation or assigning strength.",

        "text": "19\n ▶ The recommendation was assessed as conditional because some individuals who reduce their fat intake \nmight replace some of the energy from dietary fat with energy from foods that are undesirable from \na dietary quality perspective (e.g. free sugars), reducing the net benefit. It is therefore important to \nconsider this recommendation in the context of other WHO dietary recommendations, including those \non free sugars (85) and carbohydrates (86), the latter of which provides guidance on carbohydrate quality. \nThe evidence did not suggest any undesirable effects with respect to serum lipids, blood pressure or \nquality of life from lower total fat intake, but rather of small benefits or no effect (all high certainty \nevidence, except for quality of life, which was assessed as low certainty evidence). No mitigating factors \nwere identified1 that would argue against limiting total fat intake to 30% of total energy intake or less.\nRemarks for recommendation 1\n ▶ This recommendation is relevant for individuals aged 20 years or older.\n ▶ The goal in developing this guideline was to provide recommendations for both adults and children. \nHowever, the evidence was considered insufficient to support the formulation of a recommendation for \nchildren owing to the limited number of studies and inconsistent results identified for children (14), and \nthe conclusion that the adult data could not reasonably be extrapolated to children given the unique \nenergy requirements for optimal growth and development throughout childhood and adolescence. \nPrevious expert consultations on dietary fats have concluded that for children aged 6 months and above \nand adolescents, total fat intakes of up to 35% of total energy are appropriate to meet growth demands \nwithout leading to excess energy intake (59).2\n ▶ The threshold of 30% in this recommendation should not be interpreted as an upper value of intake to \nbe achieved by increasing fat intake among those with nutritionally adequate total fat intakes that are \nalready less than 30% of total energy intake.\n ▶ Evaluation of the evidence suggests that the observed effect of reducing total fat intake on measures \nof body fatness is mediated, at least in part, by dietary behaviours that affect energy balance. In most \ntrials, those who reduced their total fat intake also decreased their total energy intake (even though that \nwas not intended in the trial design), and this led to decreasing weight. This finding suggests that there \nmay be a tendency for those habitually consuming greater amounts of total fat to also consume more \nenergy than needed, resulting in excess energy intake and subsequent weight gain. However, individuals \n1 See the section Evidence to recommendations .\n2 Infants should be exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months of life to achieve optimal growth, development and health. \nThereafter, to meet their evolving nutritional requirements, infants should receive nutritionally adequate and safe \ncomplementary foods, while continuing to breastfeed for up to 2 years or beyond (9, 90).\nRecommendations and supporting information\nBox 1. Strength of WHO recommendations\nWHO recommendations can either be strong or conditional, based on a number of factors including \noverall certainty in the supporting scientific evidence, balance of desirable and undesirable \nconsequences, and others as described in the Evidence to recommendations section of the guideline.\nStrong recommendations are those recommendations for which the WHO guideline development \ngroup is confident that the desirable consequences of implementing the recommendation outweigh \nthe undesirable consequences. Strong recommendations can be adopted as policy in most situations.\nConditional recommendations are those recommendations for which the WHO guideline development \ngroup is less certain that the desirable consequences of implementing the recommendation outweigh \nthe undesirable consequences or when the anticipated net benefits are very small. Therefore, \nsubstantive discussion amongst policy-makers may be required before a conditional recommendation \ncan be adopted as policy.\nThe reasoning behind the strength of recommendations in this guideline is provided in the rationale for \neach recommendation. Additional information on assessing the strength of WHO recommendations \ncan be found in the WHO handbook for guideline development (60).",

Therefore, studies conducted \nwith overweight participants actively pursuing weight loss (i.e. “weight loss studies”) were not included \nin the systematic review used to inform the recommendation. The recommendation may therefore not \napply to individuals actively pursuing weight loss through modification of the diet, although current \nevidence does suggest that lower fat, restricted-calorie diets may be one of several effective, short-term \nstrategies for losing excess body weight (50, 91).\n ▶ This recommendation should not be interpreted as implying that total fat is the only risk factor for \nunhealthy weight gain and that reducing total fat intake alone is sufficient to prevent unhealthy \nweight gain. The etiology of unhealthy weight gain is complex and can involve many different inputs. \nTherefore, this recommendation should be considered in the context of other relevant WHO guidance, \nincluding that on the intake of free sugars (85), carbohydrates (86) , non-sugar sweeteners (87) , energy \nrequirements (92) and physical activity (93). \n ▶ Dietary fat, including essential fatty acids (which cannot be synthesized by the human body), is \nnecessary for proper physiological function. To ensure an adequate intake of energy and essential fatty \nacids, and to facilitate the absorption of lipid-soluble vitamins, total fat intake in most adults should be \nat least 15–20% of total energy intake (58).\n ▶ The decision to implement this recommendation must be made in the context of achieving or maintaining \nnutritional adequacy and avoiding excess energy intake. In populations where undernutrition is not \nprevalent, the recommendation can generally be safely implemented as needed, provided that individual \nenergy requirements are met (92), and recognizing that energy requirements are increased in pregnant \nand lactating women (9, 10, 92) . Consideration must be given to populations in which prevalence of \nundernutrition is a concern and where total fat intake may already be low. In such settings, maintaining \nor even increasing total fat intake of individuals (in line with guidance on fat quality in recommendation \n2) may be important to achieve adequate energy intake, as well as maintain or improve the overall diet.\nRationale for recommendation 2 \n ▶ This recommendation is taken from recommendations found in the WHO guideline, Saturated fatty acid \nand trans-fatty acid intake for adults and children (68) which are based on effects of these nutrients on \nmortality and CVD outcomes.\nRemarks for recommendation 2\n ▶ This recommendation is relevant for all individuals aged 2 years and older.\n ▶ This recommendation, taken together with recommendation 1, acknowledges that both quantity and \nquality of fat consumed are important for health and nutritional well-being.\n ▶ Further remarks may be found in the WHO guideline, Saturated fatty acid and trans-fatty acid intake for \nadults and children (68).",

Public health interventions should therefore aim to reduce total fat intake \nwhere necessary, while reducing saturated fatty acid and trans-fatty acid intake, through replacement with \nunsaturated fatty acids or carbohydrates as needed (68) , and without increasing free sugars intake (85).\nProviding overall dietary guidance is outside the scope of this guideline because such guidance should be \nbased on overall dietary goals that consider all required nutrients. However, it is feasible to achieve the \nrecommendations in this guideline while respecting national dietary customs, because a wide variety of \nfresh foods are naturally low in fat, and reduced fat versions of whole foods such as reduced fat dairy foods \nand lean cuts of meat are available in many countries. Highly processed foods that are high in fat should be \nreplaced with whole foods where possible, because many highly processed fat-free and low-fat products \ncontain free sugars and may contain as many calories as full-fat versions.\nThe decision to implement this recommendation must be made in the context of achieving or maintaining \nnutritional adequacy and avoiding excess energy intake. In populations where undernutrition is not \nprevalent, the recommendation can generally be safely implemented as needed, provided individual energy \nrequirements are met (92), recognizing that energy requirements are increased in pregnant and lactating \nwomen (9, 10, 92). Consideration must be given to populations in which prevalence of undernutrition is a \nconcern and where total fat intake may already be low. In such settings, maintaining or even increasing \ntotal fat intake of individuals (in line with guidance on fat quality in recommendation 2) may be important \nto achieve adequate energy intake, and to maintain or improve the overall diet.\nMonitoring and evaluation\nThe impact of this guideline can be evaluated by assessing its adoption and adaptation across countries \nthat will be monitored in close collaboration with the WHO regional and country offices. Monitoring and \nevaluation at the global level will be through the WHO Global Database on the Implementation of Nutrition \nAction (GINA)1 – a centralized platform developed by the WHO Department of Nutrition and Food Safety \nfor sharing information on nutrition actions in public health practice implemented around the world. GINA \ncurrently contains information on thousands of policies (including laws and legislation), nutrition actions \nand programmes being implemented in WHO Member States. GINA includes data and information from \nmany sources, including the first and second WHO Global Nutrition Policy Reviews conducted in 2010–2011 \nand 2016–2017, respectively (94, 95) . Through providing programmatic implementation details, specific \ncountry adaptations and lessons learned, GINA serves as a platform for monitoring and evaluating how \nguidelines are being translated into various policy actions and intervention programmes to address the \nissues related to fat intake in various countries.\nResearch gaps and future initiatives\nBased on the results of the systematic reviews and discussions with the NUGAG Subgroup on Diet and \nHealth, a number of questions and gaps in the current evidence that should be addressed by future research \nwere identified, as outlined below. Research needs include high-quality studies that assess the:\n ▶ effects of reducing total fat intake or otherwise lower fat intakes on body fatness and other metabolic \nmarkers, in particular in LMICs;\n ▶ associations between changes in body fatness and increased total fat intake in diverse populations in \nLMICs with low but nutritionally adequate total fat intakes (e.g. cohort studies in populations undergoing \nthe nutrition transition);\n ▶ effects of reducing total fat intake or otherwise lower fat intakes on relevant health outcomes in addition \nto body fatness (e.g. mortality, CVDs and cancer), noting that in some populations, the relationship \nbetween measures of body fatness and health risks may differ;\n1 https://extranet.who.int/nutrition/gina/en/home ",

This guideline will therefore be updated as part of the ongoing efforts of WHO to update existing \ndietary goals and nutrition guidance for promoting healthy diets, nutrition and the prevention of NCDs. It \nis planned that the recommendations in this guideline will be reviewed when new data and information \nbecome available. At that time, any new evidence will be evaluated, and formal updates will be made, if \nnecessary. The WHO Department of Nutrition and Food Safety, together with partners in other departments \nwithin the WHO Secretariat, will be responsible for coordinating the updating of the guideline, following the \nformal procedure described in the WHO handbook for guideline development (60). At the time the guideline \nis due for review, WHO will welcome suggestions for additional questions that could be addressed in a \npotential update of the guideline.\nUptake of the guideline and future work",

In the published systematic review, all measures of body fatness were grouped together for GRADE assessment and assigned a collective rating of high .

It was not clear in most studies if blinding of outcome assessment had been achieved. Incomplete outcome reporting was variable across studies, with many having a high risk of attrition bias as defined in this analysis (studies that lost more than 5% of participants per year were considered to be at high risk of attrition bias), though selective reporting was assessed as probably not having a significant impact on risk of bias. Most included studies had systematic differences in care (i.e. intervention arms had more time or attention devoted to them than the control arm); however, sensitivity analysis in which studies with systematic differences in care were excluded did not significantly change the effect observed on body weight, suggesting that systematic differences in care were not an important source of bias in these studies.

The heterogeneity was partly explained by the degree of reduction of fat intake, by the BMI of participants, and by the level of fat intake in control \narms, which together explained 16% of between-study variance (in meta-regression). The only inconsistency (where heterogeneity arose) was in the size of this effect. Otherwise, the direction of effects in these RCTs was remarkably consistent – 30 of the 33 comparisons showed a decrease in body weight. The reduction in weight in those on reduced fat diets was seen in very different populations and from 6 months to several years and was resistant to all sensitivity analyses, including the exclusion of: studies that gave additional support to the low-fat arms, studies that delivered additional dietary interventions (on top of the change in dietary fats), studies with suspected compliance issues, the largest study (1), and when using fixed – rather than random-effects meta-analysis. Effects on body weight are supported by similar effects on BMI, waist circumference and percentage of body fat. Therefore, although formal analysis indicated a significant level of heterogeneity that was only partially explained, additional evidence indicated that the effect was robust and consistent across a large number of studies and was therefore not downgraded.",

The last \nmeasurements in this study were made on a final visit of the children, which was at approximately 7 years after initiation of the study for many participants. The variability in the actual time of follow-up as well as attenuation of the intervention after 3 years of follow-up decreased confidence in the data for the final follow-up period. The data for the final visit is consistent with the data at both 1 year and 3 years of follow-up, in that no significant effect was observed at any timepoint.\n8  This was a well-conducted RCT with methods in place to minimize risk of selection, performance, detection, attrition and reporting bias.\n9  Downgraded once for serious indirectness: participants were children with raised blood lipids, and therefore results may not be directly generalizable to all children. \n10  The 95% CI crosses a threshold of potentially relevant benefit or important harm.\n11  Additional evidence on the relationship between reduced total fat intake and measures of body fatness in children comes from additional follow-up data of effects on body weight in this study at 1 year (MD –0.50 kg/m2; 95% CI –1.78, 0.78; 620 participants; low certainty in the evidence)\nAnnex 6.

For example, in some \nsettings, dietary fat may consist largely of unsaturated fatty \nacids and a reduction in total fat intake may have an impact \non body weight but not CVDs. In settings where dietary fat \nconsists largely of saturated fatty acids and/or trans-fatty \nacids, a reduction in total fat intake may affect both body \nweight and CVDs.

As \nnoted with respect to feasibility, however, there are many \nfor whom the recommendation will not be acceptable based \non the popular perception that high fat diets are healthy, \nparticularly with respect to losing weight or maintaining a \nhealthy body weight (19). \nLittle to no \npublished evidence \nfrom which to draw.\nFeasibility\nIs the \nintervention \nfeasible to \nimplement?\n ☐ No\n ☐ Probably no\n▶■ Probably yes\n ☐ Yes\n ☐ Varies\n ☐ Don’t know \nAs noted elsewhere in the guideline, implementing the \nrecommendations in this guideline can be achieved in \nnumerous ways (e.g. behaviour change interventions, \nfiscal policies, regulation of marketing foods and \nbeverages, product labelling schemes, and reformulation \nof manufactured products), with feasibility varying \ndepending on approach. Regardless of specific modes of \nimplementation, the recommendations can be incorporated \ninto existing activities designed to promote healthy diets. \nFor example, appropriate messaging on total fat intake can \nreadily be added to existing food-based dietary guidelines \nand behaviour change and education campaigns.\nIn settings where efforts to reduce total fat intake are \nplanned or are already underway, feasibility should be much \nhigher than in settings where plans are not yet in place. \nRegardless, feasibility will be influenced by the existing, \nrelevant infrastructure (for different interventions) and \nresources available.\nRelevant to all interventions, widespread use and availability \nof certain food items high in fat may pose challenges in \ndecreasing consumption where necessary to meet the \nrecommended intake. Regardless of which interventions \nare employed to realize the recommended fat intake, some \namount of behaviour change at the individual level will \nbe required. This may be challenging in some settings, \nparticularly those in which popular opinion has currently \nbeen shaped to view high fat intake as healthy, particularly \nwith respect to losing weight or maintaining a healthy body \nweight (19). \nLittle to no \npublished evidence \nfrom which to draw.\nAnnex 7.
