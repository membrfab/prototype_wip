Does a high-pro-\ntein diet aid in weight loss and maintenance? Can a ketogenic diet \nburn fat? Do carbohydrates increase abdominal fat? Can intermit-\ntent fasting help one lose weight? New dietary information has \nonly added to the current confusion due to several controversial di-\netary regimens, and there is no clear guidance on the optimal diet \nfor weight loss. \nObesogenic environments and biological and psychological fac-\nCopyright © 2021 Korean Society for the Study of Obesity\n This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) which permits \nunrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\npISSN 2508-6235\neISSN 2508-7576\nJournal of Obesity & Metabolic Syndrome 2021;30:20-31\nhttps://doi.org/10.7570/jomes20065 1 / 1CROSSMARK_logo_3_Test\n2017-03-16https://crossmark-cdn.crossref.org/widget/v2.0/logos/CROSSMARK_Color_square.svg\nReview",

Therefore, dietary interventions remain \nthe cornerstone of weight-management strategies, and pharmaco-\nlogic and surgical interventions also aim to improve dietary man-\nagement. \nComplex factors shape and influence diets, especially for weight \nmanagement. However, amount of food eaten, type of food con-\nsumed (macronutrient composition), and meal timing of meals are \nthe key components of weight-management strategies. In this re-\nview, we discuss several evidence-based dietary interventions for \nweight loss and weight-loss management based on these compo-\nnents. \nAMOUNT OF FOOD INTAKE\nLow-calorie diet vs. very-low-calorie diet \nThe key component of diets for weight loss and weight-loss \nmaintenance is an energy deficit. Under the “calories-in, calories-\nout” model, dietary management has focused on the concept of “eat \nless, move more,” and patients have been advised to consider and \ncalculate their calorie balance whenever they eat. However, energy \nintake and energy expenditure are dynamic processes influenced \nby body weight and influence each other.11 Thus, interventions \naimed at creating an energy deficit through the diet are countered \nby physiological adaptations that resist weight loss. \nA low-calorie diet involves consumption of 1,000–1,500 calories \nper day; deficits of 500–750 calories per day have been used for \nweight loss and are recommended by many obesity societies and \nguidelines.12-15 Low-calorie diets typically restrict fats or carbohy-\ndrates, neither of which has been determined to be more important \nfor weight loss if only a calorie deficit occurs. The 2018 the Diet \nIntervention Examining The Factors Interacting with T reatment \nSuccess (DIETFITS) study found no significant differences in \nweight loss between low-fat and low-carbohydrate diets.16 However, \nmeal planning and preparation take effort, and weight-loss mainte-\nnance requires a sustained low-calorie diet. Moreover, metabolic \nadaptations to decrease energy expenditure can lead to a plateau \nwith this type of diet, which individuals may misinterpret as “fail-\nure” due to “lack of willpower. ”\nT raditionally, a very-low-calorie diet (VLCD), which provides \n< 800 kcal a day, is not recommended for routine weight manage-\nment and should only be used in limited circumstances along with \nmedical monitoring according to obesity guidelines.12 However, a \nrecent review suggested that a VLCD used in combination with \nbehavioral programs can provide greater long-term weight loss than \nbehavioral programs alone, and that it is tolerable and has few ad-\nverse effects.17 Additionally, a VLCD with meal replacement is ef-\nfective for achieving diabetes remission in individuals with obesity \nlasting for at least 2 years.18,19 Another form of the VLCD—the very-\nlow-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD)—has been proposed as a prom-\nising option for significant weight loss in a short duration of time \nand stability for 2 years.20 The VLCKD consists of very-low-calorie \n( < 700–800 kcal/day) and low-carbohydrate ( < 30–50 g/day) in-\ntake along with adequate protein consumption (equivalent to 0.8–\n1.2 g/day/kg of ideal body weight) for a short period, followed by \na gradual switch to a low-calorie diet. The VLCKD program is rec-\nommended by the Italian Society of Endocrinology in cases of se-\nvere obesity, sarcopenic obesity, obesity associated with T2DM, \nhypertriglyceridemia, and hypertension.21 However, this program \nis contraindicated in pregnant women; those with type 1 diabetes \nmellitus (T1DM), kidney failure, or cardiac arrhythmia; and older \npatients with frailty. \nMeal replacements \nMeal replacements include not only products marketed as soups, \nshakes, and bars, but also portion-controlled, ready-made meals. \nMeal replacements are used instead of “normal” food for one or \nmore meals to reduce the daily calorie intake. Meal replacements \ncan be useful for calorie control because people tend to overesti-\nmate or underestimate the amount of calories in food.22 A system-\natic review showed the usefulness of meal replacement in weight \nloss, demonstrating a mean difference of –2.22 to –6.13 kg com-\npared with other diets involving support alone.23 Despite their con-\nvenience and affordability, meal replacements are typically not suc-\ncessful for maintaining weight loss over a long duration. \nIn summary, evidence shows that an energy deficit is the most \nimportant factor for weight loss, but metabolic adaptations to de-\ncrease energy intake can also lead to reduced energy expenditure. \nTherefore, long-term strategies for inducing an energy deficit are ",

If traditional low-calorie diet programs do not work or \nwhen there is a need for significant weight loss, a VLCD and meal \nreplacement diets can be useful options. \nTYPES OF FOOD EATEN\nLow-fat diet \nThe strategy of reducing total fat intake is widely used for weight \nloss because a single gram of fat contains more calories than a gram \nof carbohydrates or protein. A low-fat diet usually consists of a di-\netary composition of fat ranging from very low ( ≤ 10% of calories \nfrom fat) to more moderate ( ≤ 30% of calories from fat and < 7%–\n10% from saturated fatty acids). 24  However, randomized trials have \nfailed to demonstrate better weight-loss maintenance by reducing \nenergy intake from fat than other dietary interventions.25  The re -\nsults of a meta-analysis did not support use of low-fat diets over \nother dietary interventions for long-term weight loss.26  \nIn another study, although low-density lipoprotein cholesterol \n(LDL-C) level was reduced among individuals with obesity who \nfollowed a low-fat diet, triglyceride level increased and high-density \nlipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased.27  Another review revealed \nthat diets high in fat and saturated fatty acids could have unfavor-\nable effects on the gut microbiota and are associated with an un-\nhealthy metabolic state. 28  Consuming large amounts of energy-\ndense foods with a high saturated fatty acid content can cause dys-\nbiosis in the gut and is associated with obesity and low-grade \nchronic inflammation. 29  Thus, diets low in saturated fatty acids, as \nwell as those supplemented with good-quality fat and fibers, are a \nreliable and healthy strategy for people with obesity to achieve \nweight management and to prevent some types of cancer (includ -\ning colorectal cancer and breast cancer)30,31  when combined with \ntotal calorie restriction.\nLow-carbohydrate diet \nAlthough an energy deficit is the most important way to lose \nweight, weight regain after successful weight loss is very common \nand may seem inevitable. Thus, alternative dietary approaches for \nweight loss and its maintenance have become an area of interest \namong researchers and healthcare professionals.\nLow-carbohydrate (low-carb) diets have been widely used not \nonly for weight reduction, but also to manage T2DM; many random -\nized controlled trials have been conducted.32,33  A low-carb diet is \ndefined as a carbohydrate intake below the lower boundary of the \nmacronutrient distribution range for healthy adults (45%–65% of \ntotal daily energy)34  and encompasses a range of carbohydrate in-\ntake from 50–130 g/day or 10%–45% total energy from carbohy -\ndrates.35,36  With carbohydrate intake < 10% (or < 20–50 g/day), \nnutritional ketosis can occur; this type of diet is called a ketogenic \ndiet. In this situation, daily protein intake is usually 0.8–1.5 g/kg of \nideal body weight to preserve lean body mass.37  \nA systematic review and network meta-analysis that compared \n14 dietary macronutrient patterns showed that most macronutrient \ndiets resulted in modest weight loss over 6 months, but weight re-\nduction and improvements in cardiometabolic factors largely dis -\nappeared after 12 months. 38  A review of macronutrient pattern-\nbased diets without specific calorie targets suggested that the At-\nkins diet, which involves low carbohydrate intake and high protein \nintake, was effective for clinically meaningful weight loss at 6 and \n12 months post-initiation. 7  Moreover, a recent review showed that \nthe Mediterranean diet provided the strongest and most consistent \nbenefits for both weight loss and improvement in cardiometabolic \nparameters. 39  It should be noted that adequate protein intake is ex-\ntremely important in calorie restriction for preservation of muscle \nmass 40  regardless of diet. \nKetogenic diet\nKetogenic diet is characterized by an extreme reduction in car-\nbohydrate intake ( < 50 g/day) and a relative increase in the pro -\nportions of protein and fat.41  Ketogenic diets may decrease appetite \nand increase lipolysis, which may result in greater metabolic effi -\nciency for fat consumption and can provide the same thermic ef-\nfects as proteins.41  There are several types of carbohydrate-restrict-\ned diets, some of which limit carbohydrates to certain levels with-\nout restricting dietary protein and fat (such as the Atkins diet), \nwhereas others allow moderate carbohydrate intake as well as \nmoderate protein and fat intake.37  \nIn one study, ketogenic diet showed mixed effects on LDL-C \nlevel and was not superior to other dietary interventions for weight \nloss. 37  Ketogenic diet can suppress hunger during calorie restriction \nand may have some therapeutic effects on T2DM, polycystic ovary ",

However, \nmore evidence is required to confirm its effectiveness and safe-\nty.37,41,42  Similar to VLCKDs, ketogenic diet is contraindicated in \npregnant women; those with T1DM, kidney failure, or cardiac ar -\nrhythmia; and in older patients with frailty.\nHigh-protein diet \nHigh-protein diet has been popularized as a promising tool for \nweight loss because it improves satiety and decreases fat mass.43  Di-\netary guidelines for adults recommend protein intake of 46–56 g or \n0.8 g/kg of ideal body weight per day. 44  Thus, if dietary protein \nconsumption exceeds 0.8 g/kg/day, it is considered a high-protein \ndiet. Usually, a high-protein diet refers to an increased protein in-\ntake to 30% of the total daily calories or 1–1.2 g/kg of the ideal \nbody weight per day. The Atkins diet has gained popularity as a \nnon-energy-restricting, low-carbohydrate, high-protein, and high-\nfat diet.45  In addition, diets high in protein with normal amounts of \ncarbohydrates have been used to improve metabolic parameters. 46  \nDiets with higher protein intake can provide significant benefits to \nprevent weight regain.47  A satiating effect is most significant with \nhigh-protein diets, and this effect helps decrease energy intake and \nmaintain successful weight loss. \nThe thermic effect of food, which is called diet-induced thermo-\ngenesis, is increased energy expenditure that results from nutrient \nprocessing; these values are highest for protein.48  Secretion of gut \nneuropeptides that induce satiation, such as glucagon-like pep -\ntide-1 or cholecystokinin, is increased in high-protein diets.49  These \ntypes of diets also may help preserve lean body mass during weight \nloss. 50  A meta-analysis showed that protein supplementation can \nhelp preserve lean body mass in adults and older adults, although \nthe effects on muscle strength and synthesis were less clear.51\nSome studies have indicated that high intakes of protein and fat \ncan increase the risk of T2DM. 52  In addition, diets high in protein \npose a potential risk to the kidneys due to their associated protein-\ninduced acid loads, such as the sulfuric acid produced from oxida-\ntion of methionine and cysteine.53  High-protein diets do not ad -\nversely influence kidney function in healthy adults, though they are \nassociated with increases in serum urea level and urinary calcium \nexcretion, which might be related to a higher risk of kidney stone \nformation. 54  Protein from red meat consumption may increase the \nrisk of chronic kidney disease; in contrast, low-fat dairy proteins, \nfish, and seafood do not have such an effect; proteins from fruits \nand vegetables actually might be renal protective. 55  Considering \nthat obesity is associated with chronic kidney disease and a high \nprevalence of subclinical chronic kidney disease,56  long-term high-\nprotein intake, especially from animal sources, should be closely \nmonitored in patients with obesity.57\nMediterranean diet\nThe Mediterranean diet involves high intake of fruits and vegeta-\nbles, poultry, and fish and dairy products, and little to no consump -\ntion of red meat.58  The effectiveness of the Mediterranean diet for \nweight loss and preventing cardiovascular disease is supported by \nsufficient evidence.59,60  Its benefits may extend to the reduction in \ncancer risk and significant reduction in digestive cancer risk.61  Ad -\nditionally, adherence to a Mediterranean diet may improve cogni-\ntive function and decrease the risk of dementia, although the evi-\ndence supporting this association is weak to moderate.62  One sys -\ntematic review of the Mediterranean diet for long-term weight loss \nreported similar results to other diets despite greater weight loss \nthan with a low-fat diet after 12 months.63  Despite this finding, a re-\ncent review reported that the Mediterranean diet showed the stron-\ngest evidence for weight loss and improvements in cardiometabolic \nparameters (Fig. 1). 39  The Mediterranean diet is food-based, nutri-\nent adequate, and focused on vegetables, healthy fats, and fish; thus, \nit is a good strategy for maintaining long-term weight reduction. \nLow-fat and low-carbohydrate diets are good options for initial \nweight loss; in some cases, a ketogenic diet could be a viable alter-\nnative. High-protein diets may be effective in weight loss mainte -\nnance, and the Mediterranean diet not only helps with weight loss \nmaintenance, but also aids in improving cardiovascular risk factors, \ncognitive functions, and mood. \nOTHER DIETARY STRATEGIES\nPaleolithic \nThe Paleolithic (Paleo) diet is also known as the hunter-gatherer \ndiet, caveman diet, primal diet, or Stone Age diet; all these diets \nsuggest that our bodies have not evolved to handle highly processed \nfoods.64  This diet follows the nutritional patterns of early humans ",

Estimates are \nthat our ancestors took in 35% of their calories from fat, 35% as \ncarbohydrates (mostly fruits and vegetables), and 30% from pro -\ntein.65  This diet advises consuming lean meat, fish, vegetables, fruits, \nand nuts while avoiding grains, dairy products, processed foods, \nand added sugar and salt. A review regarding the Paleo diet and its \nimpact on cardiovascular risk factors suggested that it has favorable \neffects on lipid profile, blood pressure, and circulating C-reactive \nprotein concentrations, but the evidence is not yet conclusive.66  \nThe Paleo diet emphasizes vegetables and unprocessed foods, but \nit is also high in saturated fats, which might increase the risk of car-\ndiovascular disease. \nLow glycemic index/glycemic load diet\nThe glycemic index (GI) is a measurement system that ranks \nfoods according to effect on blood glucose level; the rates at which \ndifferent foods raise blood glucose level are ranked in comparison \nwith absorption of 50 g of pure glucose as a reference (GI = 100). 67  \nA low-GI diet emphasizes exchanging high-GI foods for low-GI al -\nternatives. Nothing is strictly forbidden with the low-GI diet, but \nhigh-GI foods such as white bread, bagels, cereals, mashed potatoes, \npasta, and noodles should be replaced by low-GI foods. The low-GI \ndiet offers benefits in managing T2DM and decreasing body weight.68  \nHowever, one study found no differences in weight among low-GI \ndiets and a diet based on healthy nutritional recommendations \namong overweight adolescent girls.69  The low-GI diet also does not \nprovide a complete nutritional picture and does not include recom-\nmendations for daily intake of fat, protein, or fiber. \nNordic diet \nThe new Nordic diet is based on unprocessed whole grains, \nhigh-fiber vegetables, fish, low-fat dairy foods, lean meat of all types \n(beef, pork, lamb), beans and lentils, fruit, dense breads, tofu, and \nskinless poultry. 70  This diet recommends more calories from plant \nFigure 1.

It is based on whole and minimally processed \nfoods and is high in both fiber and omega-3 fats. A systemic review \nshowed that adherence to the Nordic diet significantly improved \nbody weight. 71  However, these types of food may be not easily ac-\ncessible or affordable for everyone and may make the diet difficult \nto maintain.\nVegetarian diet \nThere are many reasons to adopt a vegetarian diet for health. \nThese diets can lower the risk of ischemic heart disease, T2DM, \nand cancer.72  Vegetarian diets can reduce blood pressure, 73  lipid \nprofiles, 74  and inflammatory biomarkers 75  and improve glycemic \ncontrol76  and other cardiometabolic risk factors. 77  This diet ex -\ncludes meat, fish, and poultry, but there are many variations of the \ndiet, including lactovegetarians and lacto-ovo-vegetarians. Dietary \nguidelines recommend vegetarian-patterned diets.78  A systemic re -\nview suggested that vegetarian diets reduce mean body weight, but \nthe studies are few and of variable quality.79  Since fish and seafood \nare excluded, this diet is low in omega-3 fats. \nDietary approaches to stop hypertension\nThe Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet \nwas originally developed to lower blood pressure without medica -\ntion, but it is now considered one of the healthiest eating patterns.80  \nThe DASH plan includes many vegetables, fruits, and grains with \nan emphasis on whole grains. Low-fat or non-fat dairy foods, pulses, \nnuts, seeds, lean meats, poultry, and seafood are also allowed. The \ndiet limits sodium intake to 2,300 mg/day and can reduce the risk \nof cancer,81  cardiovascular risk factors,82  and both all-cause and cause-\nspecific mortality. 83  The DASH diet also aids in losing weight, but \nthe differences were relatively small.84  \nPortfolio \nThe Portfolio diet is a vegan plan that emphasizes a “portfolio” of \nfoods or food components that lower cholesterol. 85  When these \nfoods are eaten together as part of a healthy diet, they presumably \nlower LDL-C better than any one of the portfolio foods could \nalone. T o include a portfolio of cholesterol-lowering foods, the diet \nrecommends daily consumption of 2 g of plant sterols, 50 g of nuts, \n10–25 g of soluble fibers from plant foods, and 50 g of soy protein; \nmeat, poultry, seafood, dairy, and eggs are not allowed. This diet \nalso helps reduce LDL-C, 86  but its effects on weight loss were small \n(–0.8 kg to –1.2 kg). 87  \nTIMING OF MEAL CONSUMPTION\nIntermittent fasting\nRecently, fasting has received interest not only from medical ex-\nperts, but also from members of the general public with an interest \nin health. Intermittent fasting involves regular periods with no or \nvery limited calorie intake. The three most widely used regimens \nare alternate-day fasting, 5:2 intermittent fasting (fasting or con-\nsuming 900–1,000 calories for 2 days each week), and daily time-\nrestricted feeding (fasting for 16–18 hours a day).88  The benefits of \nintermittent fasting come not only from reduction in calorie intake, \nbut also from its effects on metabolic switching to reverse insulin \nresistance, strengthen the immune system, and enhance physical \nand cognitive functions.88  Recent reviews on intermittent fasting \nhave suggested that, as a weight-loss strategy, it could benefit pa-\ntients with obesity and has effects comparable to daily calorie re-\nstriction.89  However, little is known about the long-term sustain -\nability and health effects of this type of fasting. \nIntermittent fasting focuses on the time window of eating instead \nof calorie calculations or macronutrient composition, helping peo -\nple to restrict food intake without having to count calories and to \navoid late-night snacking. With this diet, careful attention should be \npaid to patients being treated with hypoglycemic agents because \nfasting might cause dizziness, general weakness, halitosis, headache, \nchills, and lack of concentration, although no serious adverse events \nhave been reported.89\nMeal timing \nRecently, much interest has focused on “when to eat. ” Meal tim-\ning and the circadian rhythm have raised a novel issue in weight \nmanagement. 90  Alterations in circadian rhythms produce bio -\nchemical, physiological, and behavioral circadian rhythm disrup -\ntions, which can be caused by the lack of change between day/night \nsynchronization (such as being exposed to artificial light at night), \neating at night, or a shift in time due to jet lag or shift work.90  Eating ",

A recent review confirmed that skipping breakfast in -\ncreased the risk of overweight and obesity.93  Additionally, late-\nnight eating was associated with obesity as well as metabolic syn-\ndrome. 94  \nThe American Heart Association recommends distributing calo -\nries over a defined period of the day, consuming a greater share of \nthe total calorie intake earlier in the day, and maintaining consistent \novernight fasting periods.95  Eating a high-calorie breakfast and \novernight fasting could have positive effects on prevention of obe-\nsity, while intermittent fasting may help control calorie intake in \npeople with obesity. \nCONCLUSION\nThere is no single best strategy for weight management, although \nsome evidence-based methods have been suggested (T able 1). Re -\nducing daily calorie intake is the most important factor for weight \nloss. Low-calorie recipes, especially those for low-fat or low-carbo -\nhydrate diets, have been suggested as the first dietary strategy, al-\nthough in some cases, a VLCD is required for a short period. Ex -\ncept for energy deficit, there seems to be no significant difference \nbetween macronutrient composition-based diets. Improvement in \ncardiometabolic factors strongly depends on degree of weight loss. \nHowever, as in the Mediterranean diet, increasing consumption of \nfruits and vegetables and intake of healthy fats (including monoun-\nsaturated as well as polyunsaturated fats) can be a healthy strategy \nfor weight loss and maintenance. Additionally, increased protein in-\ntake can help with weight loss maintenance. \nEating breakfast and avoiding late-night eating should be consid-\nTable 1.
