Heads have turned to the agrifood system and the ways in which it \ncan and must be transformed to contribute to the commitments of ending hunger and all forms of \nmalnutrition, elevating levels of human health, and protecting and restoring the environment.  But \nlack of consensus of what constitute healthy diets can undermine progress and continuity of efforts \nto achieve them.\nTo accelerate progress towards the achievement of these interconnected commitments, the Food \nand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Health Organization \n(WHO) have formulated principles of what constitute healthy diets. These principles, set out \nbelow, and recognized by the scientific literature (1, 2), are underpinned by guidelines and other \nnormative elements developed by the two Organizations. Multiple dietary patterns that meet \nthese principles, and in which foods are safe, can therefore be defined as healthy dietary patterns.\nPhotography credit: © Fisher-Photostudio.",

Principles of healthy diets\nHealthy diets need to meet four core principles, universal in their application, based on human \nbiology and underpinned by evidence.  To be healthy, diets need to be:\nProviding enough essential nutrients to \nprevent deficiencies and promote health, \nwithout excess.\nIn energy intake, and energy sources \n(i.e., fats, carbohydrates and proteins) \nto promote healthy weight, growth and \ndisease prevention.\nIn consumption of foods, nutrients or other \ncompounds associated with detrimental \nhealth effects.\nAdequate Balanced\nModerate Diverse\nIncluding a wide variety of nutritious foods \nwithin and across food groups to favour \nnutrient adequacy and consumption of \nother health promoting substances.\nIn addition, diets can only \nbe healthy if foods and \nbeverages are safe. In \nother words, as Codex \nAlimentarius clarifies, \nif they will not cause \nadverse health effects \nto the consumers when \nthey are prepared and/\nor eaten. This will require \nthat all conditions and \nmeasures necessary \nto ensure the safety and \nsuitability of food at all stages \nof the food chain are implemented \n(3). Food safety ensures the prevention of \nfoodborne diseases and the efficient utilization \nof nutrients. The consequences \nof consuming unsafe food \ndisproportionately affect \nvulnerable groups, such as \nchildren and older adults.\nThe following sections \nprovide a brief \ndescription of the \nprinciples, along with \nthe current evidence and \nFAO and WHO guidance to \nsubstantiate each principle.  \nFAO and WHO guidelines and \nrecommendations are based on \nthe current state of evidence and evolve \nas new evidence emerges. \nPhotography credit: © stockfilmstudio.",

These include essential amino acids, essential fatty acids and most vitamins \nand minerals. Essential nutrients are involved in all bodily functions from growth and brain \ndevelopment in the fetus and young infant, to organ and muscle functioning throughout life. \nInadequate intake of essential nutrients can lead to specific deficiency syndromes for single \nnutrients (such as scurvy for vitamin C deficiency, rickets for vitamin D deficiency, goiter for iodine \ndeficiency), many of which are now uncommon in most parts of the world.  However, many other \nconditions – such as, among others, impaired growth, brain development and immune system \nfunction – are affected by several causes, including multiple nutrient deficiencies.\nMeeting nutrient requirements for children aged 0 to 23 months \nis particularly important given growth and development \nand the small total quantity of foods consumed.  For \ninfants 0 to 6 months of age, nutrient needs should be \nmet through exclusive breastfeeding. As of 6 months \nof age, animal source foods are a good source of high \nquality protein and bioavailable key vitamins and \nminerals.  Therefore, WHO recommends, in addition \nto continued breastfeeding, the daily consumption \nof animal source foods, including unprocessed meat, \nfish or eggs, for children in this age group (4).\nDietary requirements have been defined by FAO and \nWHO for energy (5), proteins and amino acids (6), fats \nand fatty acids (7), vitamins and minerals (8), and many \ncountries have established values for their populations.  \nThese requirements include the intake levels which are likely \nto prevent risk of deficiency and the levels that will limit the risk \nof excess.

        "text": "55\n Principles of he althy diets\nProteins provide the building blocks for much of the structural \nelements of the body, such as muscle, as well as functional \nmolecules such as hormones and enzymes. To meet the body’s \nneeds, 10–15% of calories consumed per day should be from \nprotein (6). This might be slightly more during adolescence, \nand for athletes, body builders and others actively building \nand/or maintaining significant amounts of muscle mass. \nConsuming excessive amounts of protein however can place \na metabolic burden on the body, particularly the kidneys (14). \nProtein can come from a mix of animal and plant sources, and \ndigestibility and quality should also be considered, particularly in \nchildhood and adolescence. For adults, in some contexts, switching \nto more plant-based sources of protein may be preferable to decrease risk of cardiometabolic \ndiseases (15). In other contexts, consumption of animal source foods is still important to favour \nnutrient intakes.\nFat is an essential nutrient for proper functioning of cells in the body, and two fatty acids – linoleic \nacid and α-linolenic acid – can only be obtained from the diet. Therefore, in adults, a minimum of \n15–30% of calories consumed per day should be from fat (7). High intakes of fat may lead to excess \nenergy intake and limiting intake to 30% or less may help to reduce the risk of unhealthy weight \ngain (9). Because a likely mechanism by which fat intake impacts body weight is through an \nincreased intake of calories, intakes of fat higher than 30% of calories consumed per day are \npossible, provided that energy balance is maintained and fat quality recommendations are also \nmet.  Fat consumed should be primarily unsaturated fatty acids, with 6–10% of total energy intake \ncoming from polyunsaturated fats including linoleic acid, α-linolenic acid and long chain \npolyunsaturated fatty acids (10). Monounsaturated fatty acids from plant sources should make up \nthe remainder of fat intake, after taking into consideration the amounts of \npolyunsaturated, saturated and trans-fat consumed (see 1.3 Moderate). \n \nCarbohydrates provide the primary energy source for the body. \nThe amount of carbohydrate in the diet can vary and should \nrepresent the remainder of diet after taking protein and fat into \naccount. The amount should, therefore, be 75% or less of total \ndaily calories but generally at least 45% (12).  Carbohydrates \nshould come primarily from whole grains, vegetables, fruits \nand pulses, and adults should aim for at least 400 grams of \nfruits and vegetables and 25 grams or more of naturally occurring \ndietary fibre from foods every day (12). Amounts for children and \nadolescents are scaled down from adult values based on energy intake \nat different ages (see Annex 2).\nPhotography credits: © FAO/Atul Loke and © FAO/Giulio Napolitano.",

        "text": "6\nWhat are healthy diets? Joint statement by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the World Health Organization\n1.3 Moderate\nAs reflected by the upper limit (see 1.1 Adequate),  some nutrients are essential, but in higher \namounts may lead to negative health effects. Other non-essential nutrients are associated with \nnegative health effects and therefore should be consumed in moderation or excluded from the diet. \nSodium is an essential mineral but at high intakes is associated with increased \nblood pressure (16) which can lead to cardiovascular disease. Sodium intake \nshould be restricted to 2 grams per day (corresponding to 5 grams of table \nsalt, i.e., sodium chloride) in adults and proportionately lower for children \nand adolescents based on energy intake (17). Maintaining sodium intake \nwithin this limit would help maintain systolic and diastolic blood pressure of \nadults and children in healthy ranges, with a resulting decrease in the risk of \nstroke and cardiovascular events and related mortality.\nFree sugars1 are not essential nutrients and intake should be restricted to less than 10% of daily \nenergy intake, with less than 5% associated with additional health benefits (13). \nReduction of free sugar consumption should be achieved without the use \nof non-sugar sweeteners, as evidence suggests that they do not help with \nlong-term weight control or reducing the risk of diet-related NCDs (18).\nNo more than 10% of daily energy should come from saturated fat and \nno more than 1% from trans-fat (10). Industrially produced trans-fat (e.g., \npartially hydrogenated oils) should not be used, and therefore any trans-fat \nshould come exclusively from meat and dairy from ruminant animals. See \nfurther details on WHO recommendations in Annex 2.  \nModeration refers also to the avoidance of, or moderation in the consumption of, foods that may \nhave negative health effects, particularly if consumed in high quantities. This relationship may be \nbecause they are sources of nutrients to limit, such as saturated fat and free sugars, or because \nthey contain other compounds that may be detrimental to health.  Two key considerations in this \nregard are red and processed meats and highly processed or “ultra-processed” foods. \nIn adults, high intakes of red meat are associated with increased risk of \nseveral diseases (19) and evolving evidence suggests that consumption \nof processed red meat, even at low levels, may have negative health \nconsequences (20, 21, 22).  \nA large and growing body of evidence suggests that consumption of \nhighly processed foods described as “ultra-processed” foods (UPF) \nby the NOVA classification scheme (NOVA classification group 4) (23) \nis associated with negative health outcomes. These include risk of \npremature mortality, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, overweight, \nobesity and type 2 diabetes, as well as impaired mental, respiratory and \ngastrointestinal health (24). The term UPF refers to a wide range of foods \nand beverages with a variety of characteristics.                                                      \n1 Monosaccharides and disaccharides added to foods and beverages by the manufacturer, cook or consumer, or naturally present in honey, syrups, fruit \njuices and fruit juice concentrates (13). \n     Photography credits: © Spamas and © sokorspace.\n",

Evidence \nsuggests that the associations with negative health e \nffects go beyond their fat, sodium and sugar content (24).  \nAn acceptable level of UPF consumption has not yet been defined,  \nand further research is needed to understand the relationships  \nbetween UPF intakes and disease outcomes.\n1.4 Diverse \nDiverse diets, based on a wide variety of foods, between and within food groups, are associated with a \ngreater likelihood of meeting vitamin and mineral requirements (25–32).  The only exception to this is \nduring the first six months of life when infants should receive only breastmilk.  \nDistinct food groups and foods within them differ in the content and density of essential nutrients \nand many other bioactive components (33–36).  Several prospective studies have reported lower \nmortality and diet-related NCD rates among participants with higher food group diversity (37, 38), \ngreater diversity within specific food groups (e.g., fruit and vegetables) (39) and higher species \ndiversity of whole dietary patterns (40).\nDietary diversity is, therefore, a fundamental element of healthy diets and a \nlong-standing public health principle widely accepted and advocated for \nin food-based dietary guidelines (41), FAO and WHO’s guiding principles \nfor sustainable healthy diets (42), WHO recommendations for children \naged 6–23 months (4) and the technical report on healthy diet metrics \nfrom WHO, FAO and UNICEF (43).  It is possible for people to have a \nsufficiently diverse diet across different ages, food environments, \nseasons, dietary restrictions (e.g., vegetarian) or cultural preferences \n(see In conclusion: celebrating healthy dietary patterns). \nDietary diversity is conventionally measured by a count of food groups \nconsumed over a given reference period, with or without minimum food \ngroup intake criteria (25, 44, 45).  The variety of possible dietary patterns is often \nreflected in the questionnaire. For example, Minimum Dietary Diversity for Women (MDD-W) is one \nindicator that uses intake of food groups to reflect dietary diversity. While the 10 food groups used \nfor MDD-W are universal (e.g., “milk and milk products”), when the questionnaire is administered at \na local level, the food groups are populated with examples of locally available, commonly consumed \nfoods that best represent the food group (e.g., kefir in one context, camel milk in another) (27). \nThis consistent structure allows for the capture of locally relevant dietary diversity data that is \ngeneralizable and comparable across contexts – essential for national and global monitoring of diets.\nPhotography credits: © gcpics,  © David Acosta Allely and © FAO/Luis Tato.\n",

Joint statement by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the World Health Organization\nIn conclusion:  celebrating healthy dietary patterns\nWhile the principles of healthy diets are universal, dietary patterns – the combinations of foods and \nbeverages consumed over time – are highly contextual. Dietary patterns are determined by a wide \nvariety of social, economic and environmental factors including individual preferences and beliefs, \nculture, traditions, religion, income and the availability and affordability of foods.\nMany dietary patterns can be healthy, as long as they meet the four core principles outlined above \nand are made up of safe foods.  Recommended healthy dietary patterns in context are articulated \nin national dietary guidelines that are based on local considerations and evidence and that provide \nrecommendations for combinations of food groups, their proportionality and sometimes frequency. \nDietary patterns also have important implications for the environment through their impact \non agrifood systems, including greenhouse gas emissions and use of natural resources (land and \nwater, biodiversity and deforestation). Dietary patterns are also impacted and shaped by agrifood \nsystems that, in many contexts, are constrained to provide enough nutritious food for all because of \nthe overuse of natural resources compounded by antimicrobial resistance, zoonoses, biodiversity \nloss, greenhouse gas emissions, air and water pollution and other issues.  Shifts to healthy dietary \npatterns must therefore be an important pillar of  agrifood systems’ transformation and can \ncontribute to overcoming the current inequities in access to healthy diets. \nFood-based dietary guidelines have long been used by countries to characterize healthy diets in \ncontext, and to inform consumer education. Such guidelines have the potential for utilization far \nbeyond consumer education, and to bring the environmental, socio-cultural and economic \nconsiderations needed to enable healthy diets for all to the forefront in characterizing healthy diets \nfrom sustainable agrifood systems in context. Taking these aspects into consideration, a new \nmethodology for the development of dietary guidelines with an agrifood systems’ lens will soon be \npublished by FAO (46).  \nWith this statement we urge consistency in framing of healthy \ndiets based on the four core principles outlined here, and \ncomprised of safe foods and water. We also encourage \neveryone, everywhere, to recognize and celebrate \nthe diversity of healthy dietary patterns and the \nsustainable agrifood systems that can promote and \nprotect human and planetary health. We urge all \ngovernments to develop (or update) and use dietary \nguidelines developed with an agrifood systems’ lens \nto inform policies and programmes that promote \nand enable healthy dietary patterns from sustainable \nagrifood systems for all.\nPhotography credit: © NewJadsada.\n",

To reduce the risk of unhealthy weight gain, WHO suggests that adults limit total fat intake \nto 30% of total energy intake or less (conditional recommendation)1.\n2. WHO recommends that adults and children reduce saturated fatty acid intake to 10% of \ntotal energy intake (strong recommendation). \n3. WHO suggests further reducing saturated fatty acid intake to less than 10% of total energy \nintake (conditional recommendation). \n4. WHO recommends replacing saturated fatty acids in the diet with polyunsaturated \nfatty acids (strong recommendation), monounsaturated fatty acids from plant sources \n(conditional recommendation), or carbohydrates from whole grains, vegetables, fruits and \npulses (conditional recommendation).\n5. WHO recommends that adults and children reduce trans-fatty acid intake to 1% of total \nenergy intake (strong recommendation).\n6. WHO suggests further reducing trans-fatty acid intake to less than 1% of total energy \nintake (conditional recommendation).\n7. WHO recommends replacing trans-fatty acids in the diet with polyunsaturated fatty \nacids or monounsaturated fatty acids primarily from plant sources (conditional \nrecommendation). \nCarbohydrate\n1. WHO recommends that carbohydrate intake should come primarily from whole grains, \nvegetables, fruits and pulses (strong recommendation).\n2. In adults, WHO recommends an intake of at least 400 grams of vegetables and fruits per \nday (strong recommendation).\n3. In children and adolescents, WHO suggests the following intakes of vegetables and fruits: \n(conditional recommendation)\n•\t 2–5 years old, at least 250 grams per day\n•\t 6–9 years old, at least 350 grams per day\n•\t 10 years or older, at least 400 grams per day.\n4. In adults, WHO recommends an intake of at least 25 grams per day of naturally-occurring \ndietary fibre as consumed in foods (strong recommendation).\n5. In children and adolescents, WHO suggests the following intakes of naturally-occurring \n1 WHO recommendations can either be strong or conditional, based on a number of factors. Strong recommendations are those recommendations \nfor which the WHO guideline development group is confident that the desirable consequences of implementing the recommendation outweigh \nthe undesirable consequences. Strong recommendations can be adopted as policy in most situations. Conditional recommendations are those \nrecommendations for which the WHO guideline development group is less certain that the desirable consequences of implementing the recommendation \noutweigh the undesirable consequences or when the anticipated net benefits are very small. Therefore, substantive discussion amongst policy-makers \nmay be required before a conditional recommendation can be adopted as policy.
