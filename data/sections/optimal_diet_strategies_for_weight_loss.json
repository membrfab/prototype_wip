Obesity has become one of the most important public health problems globally and is strongly associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM); cardiovascular diseases including myocardial infarction and stroke; osteoarthritis; obstructive sleep apnea; depression; and some types of cancer, such as breast, ovarian, prostate, liver, kidney, and colon cancer. Optimal diets for weight management have been a topic of debate not only among researchers, nutrition experts, and healthcare professionals, but also among the general public. According to a meta-analysis of several diet programs, calorie restriction was the primary driver of weight loss, followed by macronutrient composition. Another study examined the effects of popular diets without specific calorie targets and showed that the Atkins diet resulted in clinically meaningful weight loss after 6 months. In contrast, another review revealed that the Atkins, Weight Watchers, and Zone diets resulted in modest and similar long-term weight loss after 1 year. Recently, intermittent fasting and time-restricted eating have become popular and seem to be effective for weight loss. However, several questions remain unanswered. Does a high-protein diet aid in weight loss and maintenance? Can a ketogenic diet burn fat? Do carbohydrates increase abdominal fat? Can intermittent fasting help one lose weight? New dietary information has only added to the current confusion due to several controversial dietary regimens, and there is no clear guidance on the optimal diet for weight loss.",

However, amount of food eaten, type of food consumed (macronutrient composition), and meal timing of meals are the key components of weight-management strategies. In this review, we discuss several evidence-based dietary interventions for weight loss and weight-loss management based on these components. The key component of diets for weight loss and weight-loss maintenance is an energy deficit. Under the “calories-in, calories-out” model, dietary management has focused on the concept of “eat less, move more,” and patients have been advised to consider and calculate their calorie balance whenever they eat. However, energy intake and energy expenditure are dynamic processes influenced by body weight and influence each other. Thus, interventions aimed at creating an energy deficit through the diet are countered by physiological adaptations that resist weight loss.",

Low-calorie diets typically restrict fats or carbohydrates, neither of which has been determined to be more important for weight loss if only a calorie deficit occurs. The 2018 the Diet Intervention Examining The Factors Interacting with Treatment Success (DIETFITS) study found no significant differences in weight loss between low-fat and low-carbohydrate diets. However, meal planning and preparation take effort, and weight-loss maintenance requires a sustained low-calorie diet.

However, a recent review suggested that a VLCD used in combination with behavioral programs can provide greater long-term weight loss than behavioral programs alone, and that it is tolerable and has few adverse effects. Additionally, a VLCD with meal replacement is effective for achieving diabetes remission in individuals with obesity lasting for at least 2 years. Another form of the VLCD—the very-low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD)—has been proposed as a promising option for significant weight loss in a short duration of time and stability for 2 years. The VLCKD consists of very-low-calorie (< 700–800 kcal/day) and low-carbohydrate (< 30–50 g/day) intake along with adequate protein consumption (equivalent to 0.8–1.2 g/day/kg of ideal body weight) for a short period, followed by a gradual switch to a low-calorie diet.",

Meal replacements are used instead of “normal” food for one or more meals to reduce the daily calorie intake. Meal replacements can be useful for calorie control because people tend to overestimate or underestimate the amount of calories in food. A systematic review showed the usefulness of meal replacement in weight loss, demonstrating a mean difference of –2.22 to –6.13 kg compared with other diets involving support alone. Despite their convenience and affordability, meal replacements are typically not successful for maintaining weight loss over a long duration. In summary, evidence shows that an energy deficit is the most important factor for weight loss, but metabolic adaptations to decrease energy intake can also lead to reduced energy expenditure.

A low-fat diet usually consists of a dietary composition of fat ranging from very low (≤ 10% of calories from fat) to more moderate (≤ 30% of calories from fat and < 7%–10% from saturated fatty acids). However, randomized trials have failed to demonstrate better weight-loss maintenance by reducing energy intake from fat than other dietary interventions. The results of a meta-analysis did not support the use of low-fat diets over other dietary interventions for long-term weight loss. In another study, although low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level was reduced among individuals with obesity who followed a low-fat diet, triglyceride level increased and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased. Another review revealed that diets high in fat and saturated fatty acids could have unfavorable effects on the gut microbiota and are associated with an unhealthy metabolic state. Consuming large amounts of energy-dense foods with a high saturated fatty acid content can cause dysbiosis in the gut and is associated with obesity and low-grade chronic inflammation. Thus, diets low in saturated fatty acids, as well as those supplemented with good-quality fat and fibers, are a reliable and healthy strategy for people with obesity to achieve weight management and to prevent some types of cancer (including colorectal cancer and breast cancer) when combined with total calorie restriction.\n\n**Tags:** #LowFatDiet #WeightLoss #Cholesterol #GutHealth #CancerPrevention",

Thus, alternative dietary approaches for weight loss and its maintenance have become an area of interest among researchers and healthcare professionals. Low-carbohydrate (low-carb) diets have been widely used not only for weight reduction but also to manage T2DM; many randomized controlled trials have been conducted. A low-carb diet is defined as a carbohydrate intake below the lower boundary of the macronutrient distribution range for healthy adults (45%–65% of total daily energy) and encompasses a range of carbohydrate intake from 50–130 g/day or 10%–45% total energy from carbohydrates. With carbohydrate intake < 10% (or < 20–50 g/day), nutritional ketosis can occur; this type of diet is called a ketogenic diet. In this situation, daily protein intake is usually 0.8–1.5 g/kg of ideal body weight to preserve lean body mass. A systematic review and network meta-analysis that compared 14 dietary macronutrient patterns showed that most macronutrient diets resulted in modest weight loss over 6 months, but weight reduction and improvements in cardiometabolic factors largely disappeared after 12 months. A review of macronutrient pattern-based diets without specific calorie targets suggested that the Atkins diet, which involves low carbohydrate intake and high protein intake, was effective for clinically meaningful weight loss at 6 and 12 months post-initiation. Moreover, a recent review showed that the Mediterranean diet provided the strongest and most consistent benefits for both weight loss and improvement in cardiometabolic parameters. It should be noted that adequate protein intake is extremely important in calorie restriction for preservation of muscle mass regardless of diet.\n\n**Tags:** #LowCarbohydrateDiet #WeightLoss #T2DM #KetogenicDiet #ProteinIntake",

There are several types of carbohydrate-restricted diets, some of which limit carbohydrates to certain levels without restricting dietary protein and fat (such as the Atkins diet), whereas others allow moderate carbohydrate intake as well as moderate protein and fat intake. In one study, ketogenic diet showed mixed effects on LDL-C level and was not superior to other dietary interventions for weight loss.

Dietary guidelines for adults recommend protein intake of 46–56 g or 0.8 g/kg of ideal body weight per day. Thus, if dietary protein consumption exceeds 0.8 g/kg/day, it is considered a high-protein diet. Usually, a high-protein diet refers to an increased protein intake to 30% of the total daily calories or 1–1.2 g/kg of the ideal body weight per day. The Atkins diet has gained popularity as a non-energy-restricting, low-carbohydrate, high-protein, and high-fat diet. In addition, diets high in protein with normal amounts of carbohydrates have been used to improve metabolic parameters. Diets with higher protein intake can provide significant benefits to prevent weight regain.

These types of diets also may help preserve lean body mass during weight loss. A meta-analysis showed that protein supplementation can help preserve lean body mass in adults and older adults, although the effects on muscle strength and synthesis were less clear. Some studies have indicated that high intakes of protein and fat can increase the risk of T2DM. In addition, diets high in protein pose a potential risk to the kidneys due to their associated protein-induced acid loads, such as the sulfuric acid produced from oxidation of methionine and cysteine.

The DASH plan includes a variety of vegetables, fruits, and grains, with a focus on whole grains. It allows low-fat or non-fat dairy foods, pulses, nuts, seeds, lean meats, poultry, and seafood, while limiting sodium intake to 2,300 mg/day. The DASH diet has been shown to reduce the risk of cancer, cardiovascular risk factors, and both all-cause and cause-specific mortality. Additionally, it aids in weight loss, although the differences in weight loss are relatively small. \n\nTags: DASH diet, blood pressure, healthy eating, weight loss, sodium intake",

When these foods are consumed together as part of a healthy diet, they are believed to lower LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) more effectively than any single food could alone. The diet recommends daily consumption of 2 g of plant sterols, 50 g of nuts, 10–25 g of soluble fibers from plant foods, and 50 g of soy protein, while excluding meat, poultry, seafood, dairy, and eggs. This diet has been shown to help reduce LDL-C, but its effects on weight loss are modest, ranging from -0.8 kg to -1.2 kg. \n\nTags: Portfolio diet, vegan, cholesterol, LDL-C, weight loss",

The three most common regimens are alternate-day fasting, 5:2 intermittent fasting (where individuals fast or consume 900–1,000 calories for 2 days each week), and daily time-restricted feeding (fasting for 16–18 hours a day). The benefits of intermittent fasting stem not only from reduced calorie intake but also from its effects on metabolic switching, which can reverse insulin resistance, strengthen the immune system, and enhance physical and cognitive functions. Recent reviews suggest that intermittent fasting could be an effective weight-loss strategy for patients with obesity, comparable to daily calorie restriction. However, the long-term sustainability and health effects of this fasting method remain unclear. \n\nTags: intermittent fasting, calorie intake, insulin resistance, weight loss, health benefits",

Thus, timing of meals could have serious implications not only for weight management, but also for development of cardiovascular disease. A recent review confirmed that skipping breakfast increased the risk of overweight and obesity. Additionally, late-night eating was associated with obesity as well as metabolic syndrome. The American Heart Association recommends distributing calories over a defined period of the day, consuming a greater share of the total calorie intake earlier in the day, and maintaining consistent overnight fasting periods. Eating a high-calorie breakfast and overnight fasting could have positive effects on prevention of obesity, while intermittent fasting may help control calorie intake in people with obesity.",

Reducing daily calorie intake is the most important factor for weight loss. Low-calorie recipes, especially those for low-fat or low-carbohydrate diets, have been suggested as the first dietary strategy, although in some cases, a very-low-calorie diet (VLCD) is required for a short period. Except for energy deficit, there seems to be no significant difference between macronutrient composition-based diets. Improvement in cardiometabolic factors strongly depends on the degree of weight loss. However, as in the Mediterranean diet, increasing consumption of fruits and vegetables and intake of healthy fats (including monounsaturated as well as polyunsaturated fats) can be a healthy strategy for weight loss and maintenance. Additionally, increased protein intake can help with weight loss maintenance.",

Each of these strategies has its own recommendations regarding the amount of food intake and the type of food eaten. For instance, low-calorie diets typically involve consuming 1,000–1,500 calories with a deficit of 500–750 calories per day, while very-low-calorie diets involve 600–900 calories per day for a short period. Meal replacements can help control calories without much effort on calorie calculation or meal planning.
