        "content": "The effects of low-carbohydrate (LC) diets on body weight and cardiovascular risk are unclear, and previous studies have found varying results. Our aim was to conduct a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCT), assessing the effects of LC diets vs. low-fat (LF) diets on weight loss and risk factors of CVD. Studies were identified by searching MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Trials. Studies had to fulfil the following criteria: a RCT; the LC diet was defined in accordance with the Atkins diet, or carbohydrate intake of <20 % of total energy intake; twenty subjects or more per group; the subjects were previously healthy; and the dietary intervention had a duration of 6 months or longer. Results from individual studies were pooled as weighted mean difference (WMD) using a random effect model. In all, eleven RCT with 1369 participants met all the set eligibility criteria. Compared with participants on LF diets, participants on LC diets experienced a greater reduction in body weight (WMD– 2·17 kg; 95 % CI– 3·36, – 0·99) and TAG (WMD – 0·26 mmol/l; 95 % CI– 0·37, – 0·15), but a greater increase in HDL-cholesterol (WMD 0·14 mmol/l; 95 % CI 0·09, 0·19) and LDL-cholesterol (WMD 0·16 mmol/l; 95 % CI 0·003, 0·33). This meta-analysis demonstrates opposite change in two important cardiovascular risk factors on LC diets – greater weight loss and increased LDL-cholesterol. Our findings suggest that the beneficial changes of LC diets must be weighed against the possible detrimental effects of increased LDL-cholesterol.",

        "content": "According to the World Health Organization, worldwide obesity has almost doubled since the 1980s. Globally, 35 % of people aged ≥20 years were overweight and 11 % were characterised as obese in 2008. Overweight and obesity in adults are associated with CVD, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer. A recent systemic analysis estimated that 3·4 million deaths in 2010 were caused by overweight and obesity. Therefore, dietary measures that can most effectively contribute to reduce excess body weight and improve parameters of CVD should be further explored. The low-carbohydrate (LC) diet, in which carbohydrates (CHO) are replaced by greater intake of fat and/or protein, is a popular weight-loss option compared with the conventional low-fat (LF) diet. However, concerns have been raised with regard to the macronutrient shift with an extreme CHO restriction and the liberal intakes of fats, which may present detrimental effects on CVD risk factors. Increased intake of fat, particularly SFA, have been associated with an increase in LDL-cholesterol, and thus increased risk of CVD, whereas the LF approach has generally been supported by studies to have advantageous effects on CVD risk among high-risk patients. The WHO recommends limiting SFA intake to <10 % of total energy intake, and other competent bodies such as the American Heart Association recommend restricting SFA intake to <7%. However, these recommendations have been challenged in a meta-analysis, where the authors concluded that there was no significant evidence that SFA was associated with increased risk of CHD and CVD.",

        "content": "Supporters of the LC diet point to studies where subjects on the LC diet produced greater weight loss, greater reduction of both total cholesterol (TC) and TAG and increased HDL-cholesterol compared with their LF diet counterparts. However, studies also show significant increase or lack of reduction in LDL-cholesterol after consuming a LC diet, which potentially could be harmful, as LDL-cholesterol is an important risk factor for CVD morbidity and mortality. Therefore, concern has been raised with regard to the use of the LC diet, especially by patients with known CVD, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidaemia and/or hypertension. Due to the lack of consensus between previous meta-analyses, authors have cautioned against making recommendations based solely on the results of individual studies. It is essential to consider the overall body of evidence and the potential long-term effects of dietary interventions on health outcomes, particularly in populations at risk for cardiovascular diseases.",

The lack of consensus may be caused by the different inclusion and exclusion criteria used. For example, many previous meta-analyses have allowed a greater range in terms of carbohydrate (CHO) intake among subjects in the LC groups, ranging from 20–30 g/d up to 40–45 % of total energy, and in some studies, all subjects in one group suffered from type 2 diabetes. In contrast, the present meta-analysis included adults with increased BMI, who in some cases had associated metabolic risk factors, but were altogether regarded as healthy. Studies where one intervention group consisted solely of subjects with established associated disease such as, but not limited to, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) were excluded. Furthermore, we have reduced factors that can contribute to variation by including studies with more comparable baseline values. In the present meta-analysis, we aimed to compare a typical LC diet defined as a CHO intake of 20–30 g/d in the first phase or <20 % of total energy with traditional low-fat (LF) diets composed of <30 % of energy as fat and limited energy content, as well as determine the effects on long-term weight loss and several CVD risk factors in healthy adults by examining relevant randomized controlled trials (RCT).",

The analysis included data from eleven randomized controlled trials, which provided a comprehensive overview of the impact of these dietary approaches on health outcomes. The baseline characteristics of the participants in these studies were carefully documented, including age, body mass index (BMI), triglycerides (TAG), cholesterol levels (HDL, LDL, total cholesterol), blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), glucose, and insulin levels. This information is crucial for understanding how different dietary patterns may influence cardiovascular health and metabolic parameters. The findings from this meta-analysis could help inform dietary recommendations and interventions aimed at reducing cardiovascular disease risk. The results indicate that both dietary approaches have their merits, but the specific effects on cardiovascular risk factors may vary depending on individual health profiles and adherence to the diet.

Compared with subjects on LF diets, subjects on LC diets experienced significantly greater weight loss, greater TAG reduction, and greater increase in HDL-cholesterol after 6 months to 2 years of intervention. Despite significant weight loss, subjects on the LC diet experienced a significant increase in LDL-cholesterol compared with their counterparts consuming an LF diet. Our findings suggest that the beneficial changes of LC diets must be weighed against the possible detrimental effects of increased LDL-cholesterol. It is still uncertain how the beneficial effects of the LC diet such as weight loss, TAG reduction, and HDL-cholesterol increase translate into possible prevention of CVD. In epidemiological studies, HDL-cholesterol levels are inversely related to the risk of CHD, whereas results from studies on treatment that increase HDL-cholesterol levels have so far been disappointing. Further, large Mendelian randomisation studies indicate that increased HDL-cholesterol cannot be translated into a reduction in CVD risk. Thus, whether an increase in HDL-cholesterol levels is directly related to the reduction in risk of CHD is yet to be demonstrated. On the other hand, increased levels of LDL-cholesterol are clearly associated with increased risk of CVD. A number of studies have previously reported increased LDL-cholesterol levels in subjects on LC diets, recognising the concerns associated with this change in LDL-cholesterol concentration.",

The significant weight loss and increase in LDL-cholesterol in the LC vs. LF groups in the present meta-analysis are consistent with several other meta-analyses, but not all report significant differences in weight loss between the LC and the LF groups. Some studies concluded that dieters on a LC diet experienced less reduction of LDL-cholesterol, although both groups experienced similar weight loss. Concerns regarding lack of decrease and the great individual variability in LDL-cholesterol levels among dieters on the LC diet have been raised. Furthermore, the role of a greater decrease in TAG concentrations among LC dieters is uncertain, as reduction of TAG below a specific target has in itself not been proven to reduce risk of CVD. In addition, the associated alteration of the LDL-cholesterol phenotype from small dense LDL to greater LDL has been associated with reduced atherogenicity. Notably, large, dense LDL-cholesterol particles are also associated with increased CVD risk, especially together with low TAG levels. Studies have reported that the LC and LF diets produced different effects on the LDL-cholesterol particle size, depending on the subjects’ initial LDL-cholesterol phenotype, but with greater and less-dense LDL-cholesterol particles in subjects following the LC diet.",

Six months is too short when speaking of long-term effects, but as a few studies have longer duration, we believe that this inclusion criterion was as close as possible to study the long-term effect on changes in CVD risk factors, such as lipid values and body weight. The current meta-analysis has several limitations. First, heterogeneity was moderate to high for all variables. Sensitivity analyses suggested influence of some of the individual studies for some variables, although the WMD results remained near similar after their exclusion. Second, the observed asymmetry in some of the funnel plots raises the possibility of publication bias. Presence of publication bias could be due to unpublished studies or if some findings have been suppressed, distorted or emphasised in a scientifically unjustified manner, resulting in an inaccurate measure of the effect of LC diets on weight loss and CVD risk factors. However, the trim-and-fill analysis did not change the estimates, indicating that the effect of publication bias in the present meta-analysis could be minor.

Furthermore, from studying the data provided, LC dieters seemed to compensate with increased fat intake, ranging from 37–54% of total energy at the end of the intervention, and generally a slight increase in protein intake. It is clear that, although similar diets were prescribed at the outset, some differences in macronutrient composition are undoubtedly inevitable when subjects were not given any further directions in terms of dietary intake. The large variations in the reported CHO intake (reﬂecting limited adherence) and differences in macronutrient composition could limit the generalisability and validity of the presented data.

Variability in dietary data collection methods across studies introduces further complications, as these assessment methods are prone to substantial measurement errors. Common issues include under-reporting or over-reporting of certain food types, forgetfulness regarding specific foods, or the tendency to report what is expected rather than actual intake. This challenge persists as a major limitation for all dietary interventions, including this meta-analysis. To mitigate some uncertainty, the inclusion of studies with similar macronutrient content was attempted, particularly concerning carbohydrate (CHO) intake, as reflected in the strict inclusion criteria. Additionally, since the studies focused on individuals with increased BMI who were otherwise considered healthy, the findings may not be applicable to those with obesity-related conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and lipid metabolism disturbances.

Additionally, the LC diet was associated with more favorable changes in HDL-cholesterol and triglyceride (TAG) levels, while the changes in LDL-cholesterol levels were less favorable. However, it is important to note that none of the studies assessed the effects of the LC diet on hard endpoints such as coronary heart disease (CHD) and mortality, making it impossible to draw definitive conclusions in this area. Given that LDL-cholesterol is highly atherogenic, this raises the question of whether long-term adherence to LC diets could potentially increase morbidity and mortality. Therefore, there is a pressing need for studies with longer durations to investigate the effects of these diets on hard endpoints. Further research is essential to enhance our understanding of the significant variability in individual responses to dietary interventions. \n\nTags: meta-analysis, low-carbohydrate diet, weight loss, cholesterol levels, morbidity and mortality",

The American Heart Association provides guidelines aimed at improving cardiovascular health through dietary and lifestyle modifications. These recommendations emphasize the importance of a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins while limiting saturated fats, trans fats, and added sugars. Regular physical activity is also highlighted as a critical component of a healthy lifestyle. Adhering to these guidelines can significantly reduce the risk of heart disease and improve overall health outcomes. Public health policies should support these recommendations to foster healthier communities. \n\nTags: Cardiovascular Health, Dietary Guidelines, Physical Activity, Public Health, Heart Disease",

Recent research suggests that not all fats are created equal; unsaturated fats may have beneficial effects on weight management and metabolic health, while saturated fats may contribute to obesity and related health issues. Understanding the types of dietary fats and their impact on health is essential for developing effective dietary strategies for obesity prevention and treatment. Public health initiatives should focus on educating individuals about healthy fat choices and promoting balanced diets that include healthy fats. \n\nTags: Dietary Fat, Obesity, Metabolic Health, Nutrition Science, Public Health",

        "content": "Low-carbohydrate diets have gained popularity as a method for weight loss and management of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. These diets typically involve a significant reduction in carbohydrate intake, which can lead to various metabolic changes in the body. Research has shown that low-carbohydrate diets can result in weight loss, improved insulin sensitivity, and favorable changes in lipid profiles, including increased levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. However, the long-term effects of such diets on cardiovascular health remain a topic of debate among nutritionists and healthcare professionals. Some studies suggest that while short-term benefits may be observed, the sustainability of these diets and their impact on overall heart health require further investigation. It is essential to consider individual health conditions and dietary preferences when recommending low-carbohydrate diets as a strategy for weight management and CVD risk reduction.
