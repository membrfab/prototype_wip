      "Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are the world’s leading cause of death, responsible for an estimated \n",
      "41 million of the 55 million deaths in 2019 (1). Nearly half of these deaths were premature (i.e. in people \n",
      "aged less than 70 years) and occurred in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Obesity is a risk factor \n",
      "for diet-related NCDs and is linked to millions of deaths globally (2, 3). In 2016, more than 1.9 billion adults \n",
      "aged 18 years and older were overweight (4) and, of these, more than 600 million were obese. The spotlight \n",
      "on prevention and management of NCDs and obesity has intensified recently as a result of the COVID-19 \n",
      "pandemic, as there is increasing recognition that those with obesity or certain NCDs are at increased risk of \n",
      "adverse outcomes associated with COVID-19 (5–9). Modifiable risk factors such as unhealthy diets, physical \n",
      "inactivity, tobacco use and harmful use of alcohol are major risk factors for NCDs and obesity. The quality of \n",
      "carbohydrates in the diet has been extensively explored as a potential modulator of NCD and obesity risk.\n",
      "Carbohydrates are found in a wide variety of primarily plant-based foods and are the principal source of \n",
      "energy (i.e. calories) in the diets of many people. Metabolism of carbohydrates produces glucose, which is \n",
      "the primary source of metabolic “fuel” for the brain, and other organs and tissues of the body. Carbohydrates \n",
      "can be grouped in many different ways and referred to using a variety of terms. At the most basic level, \n",
      "carbohydrates comprise monosaccharide building blocks and can be categorized based on the degree of \n",
      "polymerization (i.e. number of connected monosaccharides) as either sugars (mono- and disaccharides), \n",
      "oligosaccharides (short-chain carbohydrates) or polysaccharides (i.e. starch) (10).\n",
      "The concept of carbohydrate “quality” refers to the nature and composition of carbohydrates in a food or \n",
      "in the diet, including the proportion of sugars, how quickly polysaccharides are metabolized and release \n",
      "glucose into the body (i.e. digestibility), and the amount of dietary fibre (11–13). Carbohydrates that are \n",
      "slowly digested in the small intestine or pass through undigested are generally considered “high quality“, \n",
      "and rapidly digested carbohydrates such as sugars are considered “low quality“. Dietary fibre, in particular, \n",
      "is an important element of carbohydrate quality. It can be defined in various ways, although virtually all \n",
      "definitions share the concept that dietary fibre is resistant to digestion by enzymes in the small intestine \n",
      "of humans (10). Consumption of low-quality carbohydrates is often associated with poor overall dietary \n",
      "quality and may have a negative health impact, whereas consumption of high-quality carbohydrates is \n",
      "often associated with high overall dietary quality and has been shown to have a positive health impact (14). \n",
      "A high intake of free sugars, for example, is associated with increased risk of obesity and diet-related NCDs. \n",
      "Consequently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has previously issued guidance on limiting intake of \n",
      "free sugars (15). Conversely, high intakes of dietary fibre and consumption of foods generally containing \n",
      "high-quality carbohydrates – such as whole grains, fruits, vegetables and pulses – have been shown to \n",
      "broadly improve health (16–20).\n",

      "Remarks\n",
      " ▶ One of the original aims of updating the guidance on carbohydrate intake was to provide guidance on \n",
      "carbohydrate quality. Having considered the available evidence relating to food sources of carbohydrate \n",
      "and dietary fibre, starch digestibility and glycaemic response, as measured by glycaemic index and \n",
      "glycaemic load, the WHO NUGAG Subgroup on Diet and Health concluded that providing guidance on \n",
      "dietary fibre and food sources of carbohydrate with consistently demonstrated benefit in terms of \n",
      "important health outcomes was the most effective means of addressing carbohydrate quality.\n",
      " ▶ This guideline provides guidance on dietary fibre intake, and also updates the prior WHO recommendation on \n",
      "intakes of vegetables and fruits (32). The scope of this guideline does not include an update to the previously \n",
      "published range of carbohydrate intake as a percentage of total energy intake, which was determined largely \n",
      "by the energy intake remaining after defining amounts of dietary fat and protein intake (32). Consequently, \n",
      "this guideline does not include recommendations on the amount of carbohydrate that should be consumed, \n",
      "and carbohydrate intake should continue to be based on recommended levels of protein (32) and fat \n",
      "intake (49). Results from a 2018 meta-analysis suggest that a range of total carbohydrate intake appears to be \n",
      "compatible with a healthy diet (52). Intakes of approximately 40–70% of total energy intake as carbohydrate \n",
      "are associated with reduced risk of mortality compared with lower (<40%) or higher (>70%) intakes. This is \n",
      "largely consistent with the range of carbohydrate intakes resulting from current WHO guidance on protein \n",
      "intake (32) and recently updated guidance on total fat intake (49).\n",
      " ▶ In addition to the benefits of dietary fibre from whole grains, vegetables, fruits and pulses, these foods \n",
      "may also contain other compounds that have been associated with health benefits (53–55).\n",
      " ▶ The recommendations included in this guideline cover all types of whole grains, vegetables, fruits and \n",
      "pulses, with caveats relating to processing and preparation, as noted in the following remarks. A variety \n",
      "of such foods should be consumed, where possible.\n",
      " ▶ Although fresh vegetables and fruits are a good choice when and where they are available, in some \n",
      "settings they present a significant risk for foodborne illness. In areas where risk of foodborne illness is \n",

      " ▶ The source of dietary fibre in the prospective cohort studies included in the systematic reviews, \n",

      "extracted or synthetic fibre added to foods or consumed on its own (e.g. fibre supplements, capsules, \n",

      "or synthetic fibre, further research on disease outcomes associated with extracted or synthetic fibre is \n",
      "needed before conclusions on potential health benefits can be drawn. Therefore, the recommendations \n",
      "specifically cover dietary fibre that occurs naturally in foods.\n",

      "that have been shown to inhibit absorption of certain nutrients, most notably minerals such as iron, zinc \n",
      "and calcium (60). These “antinutrients” include lectins, oxalates, phytates, goitrogens, phytoestrogens, \n",
      "tannins, saponins and glucosinolates, and many of these have also been shown to have health benefits \n",
      "unrelated to their impact on nutrient absorption. The extent to which an impact on nutrient absorption \n",
      "occurs varies from person to person. The inhibitory effect is generally observed only at very high intakes \n",
      "and in individuals with existing nutritional deficiencies; in the context of adequate, diverse diets, it \n",
      "is generally not significant. In addition, some simple methods of preparation, including soaking and \n",
      "heating, and more advanced methods, including germination and fermentation, appear to reduce the \n",
      "inhibitory potential. Therefore, most people can generally consume whole grains, vegetables, fruits and \n",
      "pulses with little to no risk. Those with nutritional deficiencies or at high risk for nutritional deficiencies – \n",
      "particularly undernourished children and those who rely heavily on foods containing these compounds \n",
      "as staple foods without much additional diversity in the diet – may need to adopt behaviours that \n",
      "minimize the ability of these compounds to inhibit absorption of other nutrients.\n",
      " ▶ These recommendations do not cover children under 2 years of age. However, whole grains, vegetables, \n",

      "Abstract\n",
      "The effects of low-carbohydrate (LC) diets on body weight and cardiovascular risk are unclear, and previous studies have found varying results. Our\n",
      "aim was to conduct a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCT), assessing the effects of LC dietsv. low-fat (LF) diets on weight loss and risk\n",
      "factors of CVD. Studies were identiﬁed by searching MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Trials. Studies had to fulﬁl the following criteria: a RCT; the LC\n",
      "diet was deﬁned in accordance with the Atkins diet, or carbohydrate intake of<20 % of total energy intake; twenty subjects or more per group; the\n",
      "subjects were previously healthy; and the dietary intervention had a duration of 6 months or longer. Results from individual studies were pooled as\n",
      "weighted mean difference (WMD) using a random effect model. In all, eleven RCT with 1369 participants met all the set eligibility criteria. Compared\n",
      "with participants on LF diets, participants on LC diets experienced a greater reduction in body weight (WMD– 2·17 kg; 95 % CI– 3·36, – 0·99) and TAG\n",
      "(WMD – 0·26 mmol/l; 95 % CI– 0·37, – 0·15), but a greater increase in HDL-cholesterol (WMD 0·14 mmol/l; 95 % CI 0·09, 0·19) and LDL-cholesterol\n",
      "(WMD 0·16 mmol/l; 95 % CI 0·003, 0·33). This meta-analysis demonstrates opposite change intwo important cardiovascular risk factors on LC diets–\n",
      "greater weight loss and increased LDL-cholesterol. Ourﬁndings suggest that the beneﬁcial changes of LC diets must be weighed against the possible\n",
      "detrimental effects of increased LDL-cholesterol.\n",
      "Key words: Low-carbohydrate diets: Low-fat diets: Weight loss: Cardiovascular risk factors\n",
      "According to the World Health Organization(1), worldwide obesity\n",
      "has almost doubled since the 1980s. Globally, 35 % of people aged\n",
      "≥20 years were overweight and 11 % were characterised as obese\n",
      "in 2008(1). Overweight and obesity in adults are associated with\n",
      "CVD, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer(1,2).Ar e c e n t\n",
      "systemic analysis estimated that 3·4 million deaths in 2010 were\n",
      "caused by overweight and obesity(3). Therefore, dietary measures\n",
      "that can most effectively contribute to reduce excess body weight\n",
      "and improve parameters of CVD should be further explored.\n",
      "The low-carbohydrate (LC) diet, in which carbohydrates\n",
      "(CHO) are replaced by greater intake of fat and/or protein, is a\n",
      "popular weight-loss option compared with the conventional\n",
      "low-fat (LF) diet. However, concerns have been raised with\n",
      "regard to the macronutrient shift with an extreme CHO\n",
      "restriction and the liberal intakes of fats, which may present\n",
      "detrimental effects on CVD risk factors(4,5). Increased intake of\n",
      "fat, particularly SFA, have been associated with an increase in\n",
      "LDL-cholesterol, and thus increased risk of CVD(4,6,7), whereas\n",
      "the LF approach has generally been supported by studies to\n",
      "have advantageous effects on CVD risk among high-risk\n",
      "patients(8,9). The WHO recommends limiting SFA intake to\n",
      "<10 % of total energy intake, and other competent bodies such\n",
      "as the American Heart Association recommend restricting SFA\n",
      "intake to<7% (4). However, these recommendations have been\n",
      "challenged in a meta-analysis, where the authors concluded\n",
      "that there was no signiﬁcant evidence that SFA was associated\n",
      "with increased risk of CHD and CVD(10).\n",
      "Supporters of the LC diet point to studies where subjects on the\n",
      "LC diet produced greater weight loss, greater reduction of both\n",
      "total cholesterol (TC) and TAG and increased HDL-cholesterol\n",
      "compared with their LF diet counterparts(11,12). However, studies\n",
      "also show signiﬁcant increase or lack of reduction in LDL-\n",
      "cholesterol after consuming a LC diet(12– 16), which potentially\n",
      "could be harmful, as LDL-cholesterol is an important risk factor for\n",
      "CVD morbidity and mortality(17– 19). Therefore, concern has been\n",
      "raised with regard to the use of the LC diet, especially by patients\n",
      "with known CVD, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidaemia and/or\n",

      "The dairy milk consumption by humans dates back to\n",
      "circa 7000 BC, when a modiﬁcation of the gene responsible\n",
      "for the lactase production prevented the progressive loss of\n",
      "lactase activity in early childhood following weaning, leading\n",
      "to a lactose-persistent adult phenotype. Owing to this ability\n",
      "to eﬀectively digest lactose throughout adulthood, dairy milk\n",
      "oﬀered an evolutionary advantage due to its hydration and\n",
      "rich nutritional content (1). Today, dairy milk and dairy\n",
      "product consumptions are promoted in public health policies\n",
      "worldwide and considered to play a crucial role in human\n",
      "nutrition (2).\n",
      "The worldwide milk consumption is increasing but\n",
      "this is mainly due to growth in developing countries (3).\n",
      "Conversely, in Switzerland, similarly to most developed\n",
      "countries, consumption of “liquid milk” had been dramatically\n",
      "declining, from 233 L per capita in 1950 to 51 L per capita\n",
      "in 2020 (4). The Swiss National Nutrition Survey “menuCH”\n",
      "reported a dairy intake of two portions per day in the\n",
      "Swiss population as opposed to the three daily portions\n",
      "recommended in Switzerland (5). Several reasons may explain\n",
      "these changes in nutritional behavior. On one hand is a\n",
      "trend to replace fresh milk with more extensively processed\n",
      "dairy products like sweetened milk drinks or fermented\n",
      "milk like yogurt, sour milk, or cheese (4). On the other\n",
      "hand, discussions on sustainability and carbon footprint have\n",
      "led to criticisms of the environmental impacts of animal\n",
      "products, encouraging change toward a more plant-based\n",
      "diet in the general population, not only in strict vegan\n",
      "consumers (6). In addition, with the increasing accessibility\n",
      "of genetic testing (1), the awareness of the prevalence of\n",
      "lactose intolerance, which often leads to reduced traditional\n",
      "dairy consumption despite the availability of lactose-free dairy\n",
      "products and the substitution of dairy milk with plant-based\n",
      "drinks, has been increasing (7). Plant-based protein sources\n",
      "can provide alternatives to milk for people who are allergic\n",
      "to milk protein. However, this assumption must ﬁrst be\n",
      "tested (8).\n",
      "More recently, the consumption of plant-based substitutes\n",
      "for dairy milk has increased (9). Furthermore, with the\n",
      "expansion of consumer interest in the plant-based alternative\n",
      "market, not only the non-dairy industry but also, recently,\n",
      "the dairy industry has started to extensively develop and\n",
      "promote a wide range of novel plant-based drinks, driving\n",
      "even further the consumer market for these products. Plant-\n",
      "based alternatives initially based almost exclusively on soy\n",
      "and almond includes solutions prepared from rice, oat,\n",
      "nuts, and legumes (10). In the context of this changing\n",
      "market, the average consumer proﬁle is changing from\n",
      "one requiring an exclusively dairy-free diet (e.g., due to\n",
      "food allergy or a vegan diet) to one that may temporarily,\n",
      "intermittently, or permanently replace milk with these\n",
      "alternatives (11).\n",
      "It is widely accepted that animal and plant foods\n",
      "diﬀer in composition. Proteins of plant origin do not have\n",
      "the same nutritional qualities as those of animal origin.\n",
      "Major diﬀerences besides protein content exist between\n",
      "naturally occurring nutrients in dairy milk and plant-based\n",
      "alternative drinks, such as vitamin B 12, calcium, ﬁber, and\n",
      "fat compositions and concentrations. Diﬀerences in nutrient\n",
      "proﬁle between plant-based drinks and milk have been\n",
      "systematically compared in earlier studies (12–17). However,\n",
      "most of these studies were limited to the evaluation of\n",
      "a few nutrients such as proteins, fats, carbohydrates, and\n",
      "selected vitamins and minerals. In the abovementioned\n",
      "studies, the information was also mostly based on nutrient\n",
      "labeling rather than on actual nutrient determination in the\n",
      "investigated products. Furthermore, with the rapidly expanding\n",
      "market of distinct plant-based alternative drinks with novel\n",
      "formulations, it is important to review and compare the\n",

      "An adequate diet is one that meets, without exceeding, nutrient requirements, specific for age, \n",
      "gender, body size and body composition, levels of physical activity, physiological states (e.g., \n",
      "pregnancy) and disease conditions. \n",
      "The body is unable to synthesize most essential nutrients, and therefore they must be obtained \n",
      "from the diet. These include essential amino acids, essential fatty acids and most vitamins \n",
      "and minerals. Essential nutrients are involved in all bodily functions from growth and brain \n",
      "development in the fetus and young infant, to organ and muscle functioning throughout life. \n",
      "Inadequate intake of essential nutrients can lead to specific deficiency syndromes for single \n",
      "nutrients (such as scurvy for vitamin C deficiency, rickets for vitamin D deficiency, goiter for iodine \n",
      "deficiency), many of which are now uncommon in most parts of the world.  However, many other \n",
      "conditions – such as, among others, impaired growth, brain development and immune system \n",
      "function – are affected by several causes, including multiple nutrient deficiencies.\n",
      "Meeting nutrient requirements for children aged 0 to 23 months \n",
      "is particularly important given growth and development \n",
      "and the small total quantity of foods consumed.  For \n",
      "infants 0 to 6 months of age, nutrient needs should be \n",
      "met through exclusive breastfeeding. As of 6 months \n",
      "of age, animal source foods are a good source of high \n",
      "quality protein and bioavailable key vitamins and \n",
      "minerals.  Therefore, WHO recommends, in addition \n",
      "to continued breastfeeding, the daily consumption \n",
      "of animal source foods, including unprocessed meat, \n",
      "fish or eggs, for children in this age group (4).\n",
      "Dietary requirements have been defined by FAO and \n",
      "WHO for energy (5), proteins and amino acids (6), fats \n",
      "and fatty acids (7), vitamins and minerals (8), and many \n",
      "countries have established values for their populations.  \n",
      "These requirements include the intake levels which are likely \n",

      "the risk of unhealthy weight gain.\n",
      " ▶ The threshold of 30% was selected because most of the trials included in the analyses reported total \n",
      "fat intakes of 30% or more at baseline (range: 29–43% of total energy intake) and most studies achieved \n",
      "intakes of 30% or less in the intervention arms (range: 14–35% of total energy intake). When compared \n",

      "However, the evidence was considered insufficient to support the formulation of a recommendation for \n",
      "children owing to the limited number of studies and inconsistent results identified for children, and the \n",
      "conclusion that the adult data could not reasonably be extrapolated to children given the unique energy \n",

      "expert consultations on dietary fats have concluded that for children aged 6  months and above and \n",
      "adolescents, total fat intakes of up to 35% of total energy are appropriate to meet growth demands \n",
      "without leading to excess energy intake.1\n",
      " ▶ The threshold of 30% in this recommendation should not be interpreted as an upper value of intake to \n",
      "be achieved by increasing fat intake among those with nutritionally adequate total fat intakes that are \n",
      "already less than 30% of total energy intake.\n",
      " ▶ Evaluation of the evidence suggests that the observed effect of reducing total fat intake on measures \n",
      "of body fatness is mediated, at least in part, by dietary behaviours that affect energy balance. In most \n",
      "trials, those who reduced their total fat intake also decreased their total energy intake (even though that \n",
      "was not intended in the trial design), and this led to decreasing weight. This finding suggests that there \n",
      "may be a tendency for those habitually consuming greater amounts of total fat to also consume more \n",
      "energy than needed, resulting in excess energy intake and subsequent weight gain. However, individuals \n",
      "who can maintain energy balance (or otherwise prevent excess energy intake) at higher fat intakes may \n",
      "be able to consume total fat at levels greater than 30% of total energy intake without increasing their \n",

      " ▶ The scope of this guideline was limited to developing recommendations for the prevention of unhealthy \n",
      "weight gain, not for the management of existing overweight or obesity. Therefore, studies conducted \n",
      "with overweight participants actively pursuing weight loss (i.e. “weight loss studies”) were not included \n",

      "Since that time, rates of overweight and obesity have continued to climb, and numerous studies and \n",

      "Consequently, the debate has continued as to whether the available evidence supports recommendations \n",
      "to lower or limit total fat intake. In addition, there has been a general transition to diets higher in fat, salt \n",
      "and sugars in many of the same LMICs (19–22)  where overweight and obesity have become a major public \n",

      "strength of WHO recommendations can be found in Box 1 .\n",
      " WHO recommendations\n",
      "1. To reduce the risk of unhealthy weight gain, WHO suggests that adults limit total fat intake to 30% \n",
      "of total energy intake or less (conditional recommendation).\n",
      "2. Fat consumed should be primarily unsaturated fatty acids, with no more than 10% of total energy \n",
      "intake coming from saturated fatty acids and no more than 1% of total energy intake coming from \n",
      "trans-fatty acids (strong recommendation).\n",
      "Rationale for recommendation 1 \n",
      " ▶ This recommendation is based on evidence of high certainty from a systematic review of RCTs of dietary \n",
      "fat reduction in adults in which weight loss was not an explicit goal (13) . All measures of body fatness \n",
      "assessed in the review (i.e. body weight, BMI, waist circumference and percentage body fat) were \n",
      "lower in adult participants randomized to a lower fat intake versus usual or moderate intake2, with the \n",
      "most commonly reported measure being body weight. The evidence further suggests that the greater \n",
      "the difference in fat intake between those reducing fat intake and those not doing so, the greater the \n",
      "difference in body weight (i.e. a dose–response relationship), regardless of the final level of total fat \n",
      "intake achieved. Overall, the evidence suggests that a lower fat intake has the potential to help reduce \n",
      "the risk of unhealthy weight gain. 3\n",
      " ▶ The threshold of 30% was selected because most of the trials included in the analyses reported total \n",
      "fat intakes of 30% or more at baseline (range: 29–43% of total energy intake) and most studies achieved \n",
      "intakes of 30% or less in the intervention arms (range: 14–35% of total energy intake). When compared \n",
      "directly via subgroup analysis, there was a greater difference in body weight in trials where total fat \n",
      "intake was reduced to a final level of less than 30% of total energy intake in the intervention arms than in \n",
      "trials where total fat intake was reduced to a final level that was 30% of total energy intake or more in the \n",
      "intervention arms. In addition, the observed dose–response relationship indicates a cumulative effect \n",
      "of lower fat intake across the range of baseline intakes, with a greater reduction in fat intake resulting \n",
      "in a greater difference in body weight. Therefore, although an effect on body weight is anticipated with \n",
      "reducing total fat intake regardless of the level of total fat intake achieved, the greatest effect may be \n",
      "achieved with a reduction to 30% of total energy intake or less.\n",
      "1 WHO guidance on polyunsaturated fatty acids is currently being updated.\n",
      "2 The differences in measures of body fatness reported at the end of the individual trials reflect lower body fatness in the \n",
      "lower fat intervention arms compared with the usual or moderate fat intake groups. In some trials, this was due to a smaller \n",
      "increase in body weight over time in the lower fat intervention arms than in the control arms, and in others, body weight \n",
      "decreased in the intervention arms but decreased by less, stayed the same or increased in the control arms.\n",

      " ▶ The goal in developing this guideline was to provide recommendations for both adults and children. \n",
      "However, the evidence was considered insufficient to support the formulation of a recommendation for \n",
      "children owing to the limited number of studies and inconsistent results identified for children (14), and \n",
      "the conclusion that the adult data could not reasonably be extrapolated to children given the unique \n",
      "energy requirements for optimal growth and development throughout childhood and adolescence. \n",
      "Previous expert consultations on dietary fats have concluded that for children aged 6 months and above \n",
      "and adolescents, total fat intakes of up to 35% of total energy are appropriate to meet growth demands \n",
      "without leading to excess energy intake (59).2\n",
      " ▶ The threshold of 30% in this recommendation should not be interpreted as an upper value of intake to \n",
      "be achieved by increasing fat intake among those with nutritionally adequate total fat intakes that are \n",
      "already less than 30% of total energy intake.\n",
      " ▶ Evaluation of the evidence suggests that the observed effect of reducing total fat intake on measures \n",
      "of body fatness is mediated, at least in part, by dietary behaviours that affect energy balance. In most \n",
      "trials, those who reduced their total fat intake also decreased their total energy intake (even though that \n",
      "was not intended in the trial design), and this led to decreasing weight. This finding suggests that there \n",
      "may be a tendency for those habitually consuming greater amounts of total fat to also consume more \n",
      "energy than needed, resulting in excess energy intake and subsequent weight gain. However, individuals \n",
      "1 See the section Evidence to recommendations .\n",
      "2 Infants should be exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months of life to achieve optimal growth, development and health. \n",

      "[['Die Einnahme von Metformin führt dazu, dass die Darmschleimhaut positiv geladen wird, was die Abstoßung von Kalziumkationen zur Folge hat. Diese Abstoßung behindert die Bindung an den Cubilinrezeptor, was zu Malabsorption führen kann. Daher ist es wichtig, bei einer Dauermedikation mit Metformin regelmäßig die Vitamin-B12-Spiegel zu kontrollieren. Bei einem bestehenden Mangel sollte ein Ausgleich stattfinden, um mögliche gesundheitliche Folgen zu vermeiden. \\n\\nTags: Metformin, Vitamin B12, Malabsorption, Gesundheit, Diabetes', 'Vitamin D ist ein weiterer wichtiger Nährstoff, der sowohl über die Ernährung als auch durch Sonnenbestrahlung aufgenommen werden kann. Einige Speisepilze und mit Vitamin D angereicherte Lebensmittel sind gute Quellen. Riboflavin findet sich in Ölsamen, Nüssen, Hülsenfrüchten und verschiedenen Gemüsearten. \\n\\nTags: Vitamin D, Ernährung, Riboflavin, Gemüse, Gesundheit', 'Daher muss die Empfehlung zu hohem Getreideverzehr kritisch betrachtet werden. Ungünstig ist es, wenn ein erhöhter Getreideverzehr zu Lasten anderer wichtiger Lebensmittel erfolgt, wie hochwertiges, natürliches Fleisch (bei Vegetariern/Veganern) sowie Obst und Gemüse (durch ungesunde Industriekost). Dies führt häufig zu Mangelversorgung mit verschiedenen Aminosäuren (Lysin, Isoleucin, Threonin sowie auch Carnitin und Taurin), Eisen, Zink, Vitamin B12 und Vitamin D. Die wesentlichen Aspekte der gesundheitsfördernden Eigenschaften der vegetarischen Ernährung sind: eine hohe Zufuhr von wichtigen Pflanzenprodukten wie Obst, Gemüse, Rohkost und Nüsse, reduzierter Verzehr von Industriekost und Fertigprodukten, geringerer Konsum von Zucker.', 'Auch wenn der Getreideverzehr möglicherweise günstige Auswirkungen auf verschiedene Krankheiten hat, so dürfen die negativen Wirkungen nicht außer Acht gelassen werden. In verschiedenen epidemiologischen Studien konnte der Zusammenhang zwischen hohem Getreideverzehr und Vitamin-D-Mangel gezeigt werden. Dieser Zusammenhang gilt als eine mögliche Erklärung für die vergleichsweise hohe Inzidenz an kardiovaskulären Erkrankungen in Indien trotz minimaler Fettzufuhr und insgesamt niedriger Cholesterinspiegel. Vitamin-D-Mangel ist in Indien sehr weit verbreitet. Getreideprodukte wie v. a. Brot beinhalten verschiedene Substanzen, die sich gesundheitlich negativ auswirken. Dazu zählen z. B. Gliadin, Lektine, Phytinsäure. Gluten oder Gliadin ist das Kleberprotein in Weizen, Roggen, Gerste, Dinkel und auch Hafer. Es sorgt für die vermehrte Wasserspeicherung im Teig und macht ihn geschmeidig. Für die heutige industrielle Brotherstellung werden Getreide mit hohem Glutenanteil eingesetzt. Das aus ihnen hergestellte Brot ist locker und geschmeidig. Dazu wurde durch Züchtung der Glutengehalt im Getreide ständig erhöht (in USA > 30 %).', 'Calcium ist wichtig für die Knochengesundheit und kann aus Gemüse, Nüssen, Hülsenfrüchten und mit Calcium angereicherten Lebensmitteln gewonnen werden. Eisen ist ein weiterer kritischer Nährstoff, dessen Verfügbarkeit durch den gleichzeitigen Verzehr von Vitamin C-reichen Lebensmitteln verbessert werden kann. Schwangere und stillende Frauen sollten bei nachgewiesenem Eisenmangel ein Eisenpräparat einnehmen. \\n\\nTags: Calcium, Eisen, Knochengesundheit, Schwangerschaft, Ernährung', 'Jod ist ein essentielles Spurenelement, das über jodiertes Speisesalz und Meeresalgen aufgenommen werden kann. Goitrogene Substanzen in bestimmten pflanzlichen Lebensmitteln können die Bioverfügbarkeit von Jod mindern. Schwangere und stillende Frauen sollten Jodtabletten einnehmen, um ihren Bedarf zu decken. Zink ist ebenfalls wichtig und kann durch Vollkorn, Hülsenfrüchte und Nüsse aufgenommen werden. \\n\\nTags: Jod, Zink, Ernährung, Schwangerschaft, Bioverfügbarkeit', 'Vitamin B12 ist in der veganen Ernährung ein kritischer Nährstoff, da er in nicht angereicherten Lebensmitteln kaum vorkommt. Lebensmittel pflanzlicher Herkunft können durch bakterielle Gärung Spuren von Vitamin B12 enthalten, jedoch ist die Bioverfügbarkeit unklar. Shiitake-Pilze und Meeresalgen können Vitamin B12 liefern, sind jedoch nicht als alleinige Quelle geeignet. Veganer sollten ein Vitamin-B12-Präparat einnehmen, um ihren Bedarf zu decken. \\n\\nTags: Vitamin B12, vegane Ernährung, Bioverfügbarkeit, Nahrungsergänzung, Gesundheit', 'Vitamin E, A und C spielen eine wichtige Rolle in der Ernährung von Menschen mit Diabetes. Diese Vitamine sowie β-Carotin werden mit der Verbesserung der Immunfunktion in Verbindung gebracht. Bei Diabetes mellitus, insbesondere bei schlecht eingestellter Stoffwechsellage, ist der oxidativen Stress erhöht, was die Frage aufwirft, ob eine gesteigerte Zufuhr von Antioxidanzien vorteilhaft sein könnte. \\n\\nLangfristige Supplementierung von Vitamin E und C scheint die Glykierung von Hämoglobin zu verringern, jedoch besteht auch das Risiko negativer Folgen durch die Einnahme von Antioxidanzien. Der Nutzen für den Glukosestoffwechsel ist insgesamt eingeschränkt, weshalb eine Supplementierung nicht empfohlen werden kann. \\n\\nTags: Vitamin E, Vitamin C, Antioxidanzien, Immunfunktion, Glukosestoffwechsel', 'Die individuelle Ernährungsweise sollte den Bedarf an Vitaminen, Mineralstoffen und Spurenelementen decken, weshalb die Lebensmittelauswahl entsprechend angepasst werden sollte. Zudem ist es möglich, den individuellen Versorgungsstatus mit Mikronährstoffen durch Blut- und Urinanalysen zu bestimmen. Diese Analysen können Aufschluss darüber geben, ob ein Mangel vorliegt, der durch Supplemente ausgeglichen werden sollte. \\n\\nAktuelle Studien zeigen jedoch, dass die Vorteile von Mikronährstoffergänzungen über Supplemente nicht ausreichend abgesichert sind. Die Auswirkungen der Nährstoffaufnahme werden oft nur geringfügig im Vergleich zu den Wirkungen von Medikamenten gemessen und unterliegen erheblichen Einflüssen auf die Messergebnisse. \\n\\nTags: Ernährung, Mikronährstoffe, Blutanalysen, Supplemente, Gesundheit', 'TABLE 4 Mean values and range of vitamins analyzed for different plant based drinks and cow’s milk. \\n\\nVitamin Unit Almond drink Cashew drink Coconut drink Cow’s milk Hemp drink Oat drink Rice drink Soy drink Spelt drink N 4 2 3 2 1 4 5 7 1 Mean Min/ Max Mean Min/ Max Mean Min/ Max Mean Min/ Max Mean Mean Min/ Max Mean Min/ Max Mean Min/ Max Mean C µg 100 g−1 n.d. - n.d. - n.d. - 202.3 0.0/404.6 n.d. n.d. - n.d. – n.d. - n.d.
